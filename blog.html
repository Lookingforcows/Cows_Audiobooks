            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my new site. I thought this might be a nice place to get away from the wasteland the internet has become. Aren't things grand? Yay! Anyhow, I'm glad you are here. I'll try to post to this as often as I can. I am currently taking a day-long break from recording "The Shepherd of the Hills", but hope to be back at it by tomorrow. The dialogue and the dialect have been a challenge, and it seems to leave me mentally exhausted a lot easier than "Pride and Prejudice" did. But I will keep at it! Good luck looking for cows out there.

            <h2>P.S</h2>
            <p>I am at work writing orginal stories as well. I have about three hours of story that I feel good about, but sometimes after putting things away and coming back to them, they don't feel so good. One of the things I am working on I started back in 2001. It was called the Clone Chronicles back then, but I don't think I'll be using that title. 17 and 18-year-old me tried hard, but there is a lot of story garbage to clean so to speak. The book is so really really gory, which if anyone could make a time machine and go back and give little me a hug that would be great. They'll try to run, but hold on to them, they need it. The second half of the novel is people talking about social issues, which is cool and all but no one wants to hear the original run time of 9 hours (if it had been read aloud, which it obviously has not. Shame on you little me!)It won't be that long. I started changing it into this podcast format because even with all the first-time-writer stuff, there's a gem there that can be chiseled. So like Shizuku was left to do in her own work in Whisper of the Heart, I will do. I also have a coastal magic story, but that's not ready yet either. Okay, you talked me into it. Here's a rough draft, let me know what you think. Laters!
