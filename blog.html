Hello, fellow cow watchers, 


Lookingforcows.com is a thing! That is a random thing to update the site about suddenly, but big things are coming. In a strange twist of fate, I worked in a coastal town. Life is strange, in a less toxic sort of way than some gaming companies out there hoping to not have to file bankruptcy soon.  I’ve been busy, but I have good news. Whisper’s Bay is coming soon. Very soon. I have a new studio set up, a story, and some amazing artwork coming from the podcasts adopted freelance artist. (https://www.instagram.com/castleblockart/) I love the new story so much, that I can not wait to share it. This might sound vain, but I also wrote my favorite villain of all time. Do take that with a grain of salt, because that is a “you have to read between the lines” statement sort of thing. When you hear the story, you’ll know what I mean. My point is, beware the High Wizard of Snufferclyde. 

With one series almost ready, it brings the dread of coming up with new ideas. I am in no rush. Bless those who are in the grind turning whatever out to make content, but I have no interest. I like to think of Cow’s Audiobooks as a specialty shop so to speak. Maybe like a “not a magic tea shop” sort of place. When there is a new tea product on the menu, it’s been grown, nurtured, and ensured there is no ill-intent on hwhitlocks. I mean. People. Flowers take time to grow, and I never know which idea I plant will sprout into something. Le miserable in Space maybe? Not going to lie, part of me wants to take a deep drive in French culture for that. But like Saku and other Dine' (Navajo) like characters, I want to make sure I have some sort of actual understanding of the people and the environment. Even if fictional. 

I also started a mailing list! So let’s have a real moment here. I hate mailing lists. Spam sucks. You don’t need to get an email from me every day. I’m not sure what my goals are there, but I like the idea of a few messages a year. I might talk about some cows I’ve seen. It’s going to be chill. Totally also note that while I’d love to sell T-shirts with the podcast’s adopted freelance artist art (and 

Like I told someone recently, We are making art here at lookingforcows.com. There is no rush. Do you know why? Because you should also be out there. Looking for cows. That’s what this is all about. So. I’ll get back to work on bringing you some verbal ear company as you look. Check back here on the site soon. Let’s make art here.

        <div class="post">
            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my new site. I thought this might be a nice place to get away from the wasteland the internet has become. Aren't things grand? Yay! Anyhow, I'm glad you are here. I'll try to post to this as often as I can. I am currently taking a day-long break from recording "The Shepherd of the Hills", but hope to be back at it by tomorrow. The dialogue and the dialect have been a challenge, and it seems to leave me mentally exhausted a lot easier than "Pride and Prejudice" did. But I will keep at it! Good luck looking for cows out there.

            <h2>P.S</h2>
            <p>I am at work writing original stories as well. I have about three hours of story that I feel good about, but sometimes after putting things away and coming back to them, they don't feel so good. One of the things I am working on I started back in 2001. It was called the Clone Chronicles back then, but I don't think I'll be using that title. 17 and 18-year-old me tried hard, but there is a lot of story garbage to clean so to speak. The book is so really really gory, which if anyone could make a time machine and go back and give little me a hug that would be great. They'll try to run, but hold on to them, they need it. The second half of the novel is people talking about social issues, which is cool and all but no one wants to hear the original run time of 9 hours (if it had been read aloud, which it obviously has not. Shame on you little me!)It won't be that long. I started changing it into this podcast format because even with all the first-time-writer stuff, there's a gem there that can be chiseled. So like Shizuku was left to do in her work in Whisper of the Heart, I will do. I also have a coastal magic story, but that's not ready yet either. Okay, you talked me into it. Here's a rough draft, let me know what you think. Laters!
