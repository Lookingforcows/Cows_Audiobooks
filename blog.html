        <h2>December 7, 2024 Update</h2>
        <p>Hello, fellow cow watchers,</p>
        <p>
            Lookingforcows.com is a thing! That is a random thing to update the site about suddenly, but big things are
            coming. In a strange twist of fate, I worked in a coastal town. Life is strange, in a less toxic sort of way
            than some gaming companies out there hoping to not have to file bankruptcy soon. I’ve been busy, but I have
            good news. Whisper’s Bay is coming soon. Very soon. I have a new studio set up, a story, and some amazing
            artwork coming from the podcast's adopted freelance artist. (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/castleblockart/">Castleblockart</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
            I love the new story so much, that I can not wait to share it. This might sound vain, but I also wrote my
            favorite villain of all time. Do take that with a grain of salt because that is a “you have to read between
            the lines” statement sort of thing. When you hear the story, you’ll know what I mean. My point is, beware
            the High Wizard of Snufferclyde.
        </p>
        <p>
            With one series almost ready, it brings the dread of coming up with new ideas. I am in no rush. Bless those
            who are in the grind turning whatever out to make content, but I have no interest. I like to think of Cow’s
            Audiobooks as a specialty shop so to speak. Maybe like a “not a magic tea shop” sort of place. When there is
            a new tea product on the menu, it’s been grown, nurtured, and ensured there is no ill-intent on hwhitlocks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also started a mailing list! So let’s have a real moment here. I hate mailing lists. Spam sucks. You don’t
            need to get an email from me every day. I’m not sure what my goals are there, but I like the idea of a few
            messages a year. I might talk about some cows I’ve seen. It’s going to be chill.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like I told someone recently, we are making art here at lookingforcows.com. There is no rush. Do you know
            why? Because you should also be out there. Looking for cows. That’s what this is all about. So. I’ll get
            back to work on bringing you some verbal ear company as you look. Check back here on the site soon. Let’s
            make art here.

 <h2>May 30, 2024 Update</h2>    
    <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my new site. I thought this might be a nice place to get away from the wasteland the internet has become. Aren't things grand? Yay! Anyhow, I'm glad you are here. I'll try to post to this as often as I can. I am currently taking a day-long break from recording "The Shepherd of the Hills", but hope to be back at it by tomorrow. The dialogue and the dialect have been a challenge, and it seems to leave me mentally exhausted a lot easier than "Pride and Prejudice" did. But I will keep at it! Good luck looking for cows out there.</p>

        <h2>P.S.</h2>
        <p>
            I am at work writing original stories as well. I have about three hours of story that I feel good about, but sometimes after putting things away and coming back to them, they don't feel so good. One of the things I am working on I started back in 2001. It was called the Clone Chronicles back then, but I don't think I'll be using that title. 17 and 18-year-old me tried hard, but there is a lot of story garbage to clean so to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, you talked me into it. Here's a rough draft, let me know what you think. Laters!
