        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Dear Cow Watchers,</p>
        <p>I have finished all the bonus episodes of "The Shepherd of the Hills" and included a supercut to create a full audiobook. Check it out and tell me what you think! In about a week, I'll keep only the full audiobook and delete the episodes to avoid cluttering up the podcast. Which classic book would you like me to tackle next?</p>
        <p>My original series is still a ways off, and life events are holding me back somewhat from writing more. I am stuck on part three of "Whisper Bay" and sort of want to revisit one of the old series. It'll happen all in good time, but it's frustrating. There might be too much going on in "Whispers Bay" that makes things too difficult. Also, in a magical world, ensuring the listener is tracking all the weird and wacky events is challenging.</p>
        <p>The third episode dives into exploring the societal aspect of the coastal cities' magic users and how stuck-up and privileged they are. Privileged not in the sense of boomers yelling at kids to earn everything like they did back in 57 when they worked at a gas station for a month until someone walked in and asked them to be a movie producer. But in the sense that they feel they are special when they are not. A lot of this comes from reading "Harry Potter" and thinking about how awful those people are. Not only with the whole muggle thing but with how they treat heavy-set people and anyone who isn't white and English-speaking. I want to explore that aspect, but I also don't want the listener to feel like they are living with the Dursleys. I also strongly don't want it to come off as a Harry Potter fan fiction, so the world creation has been slow. The setting idea comes from living on the west coast and running into a tea shop that was never open when I'd go to visit. It seemed sus, and I thought it would be a fun story.</p>
        <p>Konigsberg, the mail-carrying owl, is still my favorite character in "Whisper Bay". That poor owl. Why are they making owls carry mail when they can teleport stuff? Why can't magic users help nonmagic people out and cure things like cancer? These are things I address in the series.</p>
        <p>One thing I learned while reading this last classic is the importance of characters making hard decisions. Mr. Howitt makes a few, but for most of the novel, he seems to go along with the plot. Being that the story was written by a preacher, this is to be expected. But it got me thinking of games like the original "Life is Strange". The choices Max makes are super hard. There's a lot about the game that isn't goodâ€”the dialogue and even the story structure if we want to be honest but it's somehow such still amazing. It's the characters that make it work. This is something I've decided to work on in my writing: making sure the character has to make tough choices with consequences that the listener understands. What are some tough character choices made in your favorite stories?</p>
        <p>That's enough for now. Let me know on social media what you want me to read next and share your favorite hard choice from a story. Until next time, I hope you find some cows.</p>
