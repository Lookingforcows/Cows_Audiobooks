<p id="page_2" class="calibre5"><span class="calibre2">The Aurore Reset</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre2">Episode 1: Future Treats</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I know this is strange. And shouldn’t have happened. But, before I explain, promise me you will</span> <span class="calibre2">try to remember a few things. I regret what I did thinking back. Maybe wait to judge stuff? Also,</span> <span class="calibre2">remember you would have taken off your clothes for that much money too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Everything started back on October 16th, 2002.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Long story short, my mom sometimes tried to save money on beer by buying a 12 pack.</span> <span class="calibre2">Intending to drink a can a night. Then the beer would be gone by morning. It had been a 12 pack</span> <span class="calibre2">night. After slamming the glass sliding door in front of my mom laying on the sofa, I left home.</span> <span class="calibre2">With anything I had important left stuffed in my emotional support hoodie pocket and a side</span> <span class="calibre2">saddle bag. And my math book. I couldn’t afford to pay the fine if I didn’t return it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Yes. I have an emotional support hoodie. Leave me alone. The point is, when I left I decided I</span> <span class="calibre2">wasn’t going back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The issue was I had nowhere to go. Not after ruining everything over a stupid argument.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Do you have places you go to when you get stuck? When the world feels like it is closing in on</span> <span class="calibre2">me, I end up in the park or Neonopolis. Usually, I went to Mia’s. Unless her mom was home,</span> <span class="calibre2">which is like almost never right? Well, that night I walked to the park in the dark. Hoping I could</span> <span class="calibre2">hide out behind a bush or something until I could figure out what to do. I have a bush I like. But</span> <span class="calibre2">anywhere there works. I needed a moment to breathe and to feel safe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">To my surprise, I saw a giant raised stage full of colorful lights. A crowd of partying teenagers</span> <span class="calibre2">and adults danced around, soaked in paint. The hand thingy reached 10:30 on my plastic watch. I</span> <span class="calibre2">wondered who would allow a party on a Tuesday night? The crowd cheered and held up their</span> <span class="calibre2">arms as the paint-spattered. I sighed. I thought about heading to my second spot but I figured</span> <span class="calibre2">wandering around Las Vegas at night wasn't a great idea.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A voice I can only describe as a ditzy tree beard who focused on weird words, came from behind</span> <span class="calibre2">me. I jumped. I faced a woman a little older than me wearing giant swim goggles. Spattered with</span> <span class="calibre2">so much pigment I’m not sure how she could see.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Azami, I presume.” She said, adjusting her shower cap wet with paint. “Or. Aurore Chandler it</span> <span class="calibre2">looks like is your other name.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Not knowing what to say to this I shrugged. “Yeah, I’m Aurore Chandler?”</span></p>
<p id="page_3" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“This is yours.” From inside her multi-color plastic coat pocket, she handed me a small flat white</span> <span class="calibre2">package. It had a strange ice cream cone logo on the front.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t think this is mine.” I tried to hand it back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Oh no. I can’t take it back. Make sure you watch the video when you turn 18 at midnight. You</span> <span class="calibre2">can go in. You’re an employee now, you’re on the list. Good luck. And don’t forget to wash your</span> <span class="calibre2">hands.” She said looking at the box.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Watch the video?” I asked. The box in my hand didn’t weigh as much as a video tape. “How did</span> <span class="calibre2">you know-”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She ran into the crowd, past the entrance, not bothered by the flying paint from the super soakers</span> <span class="calibre2">on stage. The ticket woman with all the tattoo’s didn’t stop me from going into the event so I ran</span> <span class="calibre2">after the goggled lady.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">As I made my way through the people after her, a familiar face popped into view. She danced,</span> <span class="calibre2">kind of, wearing an orange tank top and ripped jeans.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Oh no. Mia’s here.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">You see, I had decided she and I shouldn’t be friends anymore. Not after our last fight. Like,</span> <span class="calibre2">when the world feels like it’s going to explode, she’s the one who helps out. But, I suck and can’t</span> <span class="calibre2">keep friends. Of course, she would be there that night too. I looked at my knuckles, which had</span> <span class="calibre2">finally started kinda looking normal again. Not so purple and swollen. The colors fell on the</span> <span class="calibre2">white package before I could jam it in my hoodie pocket. I turned from the stage to walk to the</span> <span class="calibre2">back of the park past the concession stands. From there I could take the sidewalk with the</span> <span class="calibre2">working street lights. Until I could figure something out. I also have a fear of confrontation,</span> <span class="calibre2">which I’m sure didn’t factor into anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Then she saw me. With a clear view, no head or body part obstructed. Her eyes narrowed at me. I</span> <span class="calibre2">felt like there should have been western showdown theme playing or something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I turned around, pretending to look at whatever else. I picked a fried sweet potato stand in the</span> <span class="calibre2">corner of the park and did not look away for as long as I could. My head turned back in the</span> <span class="calibre2">direction of where she had been standing. She stared at me. I bet she never looked away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Too many people touched me as I pushed my way through the crowd to her. My nose bumped up</span> <span class="calibre2">against hers. She stood back, with that dirty blond, mid-length, side-parted, curly hair. The</span> <span class="calibre2">orange tank top glowed in the neon lights. Her eyes gave me the wild bear look. Blue eyes with a</span> <span class="calibre2">hint of green and gray with little specks of like an auburn sort of color thing? Guess you know.</span></p>
<p id="page_4" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Anyways. She looked ticked. She pointed. I knew what she was pointing to, which was any place</span> <span class="calibre2">away from the crowd of people. I went with her. Partly having nowhere to run. Partly because I</span> <span class="calibre2">missed her. But I felt like I was “old yeller” being taken behind a shed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Once we got away from the noise and constant paint showers, she took out her earplugs. She</span> <span class="calibre2">wrinkled her nose at me. Someone chucked a trash bag into a dumpster near the parked food</span> <span class="calibre2">trucks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Like. Are you following me again? Like, when you wanted that stupid note from Sally in Jr.</span> <span class="calibre2">High?” She said, with that pinch of that whatever that low-pitch California emo thing of hers is.</span> <span class="calibre2">“Who the hell talks to Sally? No one. Her parents aren’t even alive. Why are you here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Sometimes my brain needs time to shift through all the random thoughts that pop up. Her eyes</span> <span class="calibre2">rolled. She waited, knowing my head also runs on volunteer hamsters, which there aren’t too</span> <span class="calibre2">many of.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Instead of answering her question, I was like. “I know I punched a hole in your wall. I shouldn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">have done that over our ‘Mongolian BBQ’ vs ‘Mongolian grill’ fight-”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She let out an angry sigh. “It is not called Mongolian BBQ! It’s Mongolian grill! You make it</span> <span class="calibre2">sounds like they’re barbecuing Mongolians! That’s horrible! No one wants that unless it’s a name</span> <span class="calibre2">for a punk rock band!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I will not back down. But I’m sor-” I stopped myself. The “S” word is one of our forbidden</span> <span class="calibre2">words we promised not to use with each other. “I wish I could be better. I need your help.</span> <span class="calibre2">Something happened. I got this thing, I don’t know what to do with it. And nowhere to go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“12 pack night?” She asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Come over for coffee?” She didn’t look at me when she said it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What??” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Um. Okay?” She mumbled, “I didn’t like that wall anyways. You should have called me.”</span></p>
<p id="page_5" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You told me you never wanted to speak to me again. I messed everything up. I can’t do</span> <span class="calibre2">anything right and I don’t deserve you at all, to be-” I said, hitting myself with words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She put a finger to my lips and closed her eyes. “Easy. The past is dead. We can always start</span> <span class="calibre2">over. You know, if you would take it easier on yourself, we wouldn’t fight. Never mind. I know</span> <span class="calibre2">where we can get a van. Let's go to my house and look at those math notes you didn’t take. The</span> <span class="calibre2">class we need to pass if we want to graduate? I’m adding ‘Mongolian’ to our list of things we</span> <span class="calibre2">don’t talk about. That mean’s you're on your own in next week's history test, which I am</span> <span class="calibre2">sorr-regretful of. Also. My mom is home early from the trip again. So. Be ready for that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Does your mom know? About us?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She did that weird lip thing she does when she’s not sure how to answer something. The music</span> <span class="calibre2">stopped playing. The lights went out, and people headed to their cars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’ll be back.” She ran in a random direction. I found a park bench and waited.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A glow of fireflies greeted me in the parking lot as I watched the people leave and the food</span> <span class="calibre2">trucks pack up. Feeling the package in the hoodie pocket, I wondered if she would return.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A bang rangout nearby, and a familiar old white hippie van drove to onto the curb in front of me.</span> <span class="calibre2">Mia sat in the driver's seat and motioned me with her head to get in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Does your aunt know you have her van?” I asked, slamming my door after climbing into the</span> <span class="calibre2">passenger seat. She frowned and closed her eyes. She breathed out with her tongue partly</span> <span class="calibre2">sticking out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It’s mine after I get the money together.” She said, revving the engine. The van sped down the</span> <span class="calibre2">street, more than likely over the speed limit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Finally, she is like “Can you change the tape? And put in the ‘Aurore’s birthday mix’?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Cassette tapes were sprawled out between the seats and on the floor, like usual. Mia didn’t want</span> <span class="calibre2">to spend the 10 bucks on an adapter for the van's CD player, so she made tapes. She recorded a</span> <span class="calibre2">bunch of stuff so she and her aunt could have something to listen to on the way back and forth</span> <span class="calibre2">from the court. Unless Ms. Kaye was home from a business trip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“How did you know my birthday was today?” I asked, reaching for the tape.</span></p>
<p id="page_6" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s a stupid question” she replied, and for once, she focused on the road so she wouldn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">have to look at me. “I was hoping you would call me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why didn’t you call me?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She let out an angry snort of air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Something in my hoodie began to vibrate. Loud enough hear it. Her face became ghost white.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why the hell is that shaking?” She asked, gripping the steering wheel harder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The intensity grew stronger and stronger in cycles of buzzing. Stopping then starting again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s what the goggled lady gave me.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Who? GET IT OUT OF HERE!” She shouted. The van drove into a roundabout. She reached</span> <span class="calibre2">inside my hoodie and grabbed the box. She tossed the package outside onto the gravel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia stretched out her arms to protect her face and got closer to me. I covered my head. We</span> <span class="calibre2">waited for what we thought would be an explosion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The box kept moving on the rocks. We got out of the vehicle. It shook on the ground at our feet.</span> <span class="calibre2">But it didn’t explode.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We looked at each other. “Hello from Future Treats!” We heard from inside. The lid blew open.</span> <span class="calibre2">Confetti fell everywhere, “We care.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What the hell?” Mia shouted. “Where did that come from?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A truck horn honked as it drove across the sidewalk to pass. She looked back to the van that</span> <span class="calibre2">blocked the roundabout.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“If it’s not going to blow up, let’s take it with us.” She picked up some confetti and put some in</span> <span class="calibre2">her pockets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We got in and raced away. She pulled over again when it looked safe to park. We both looked at</span> <span class="calibre2">the package. I opened it. She ducked behind me. The device looked like a futuristic handheld</span> <span class="calibre2">PDA. A red screen on a square device switched on. The ice cream logo turned red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A name appeared on the screen.</span></p>
<p id="page_7" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“A.z.a.m.i? I have no idea what an “Azami” is. Or how I would pronounce something like that.”</span> <span class="calibre2">I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Under that name appeared mine. Aurore. The device began to talk as if a person were speaking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Let’s get to work!” It said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We looked at each other. “Why does the PDA vibrate?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Hi, Azzzzssssami! Let’s start the employee video.” I wasn’t sure if the device thing glitched out,</span> <span class="calibre2">or if that’s how you say that name. Or if the device was supposed to shock and burn my hand a</span> <span class="calibre2">little or not?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I turned to her and I’m like, “Did that thing call me ‘A-zam-ee’?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She shrugged. “Did that thing shock you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Meh.” I shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A video played on the PDA thing. An ice cream scoop crossed the screen. Words appeared. The</span> <span class="calibre2">picture was sharper and clearer than anything we had ever seen. I wish I could see the rest of the</span> <span class="calibre2">world with that kind of clarity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“This is nuts,” Mia exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A flash blinded us. The ground shook. I felt this strange sensation all over my body. When I</span> <span class="calibre2">could see again, the light from objects bent in strange ways. Light from everything spun towards</span> <span class="calibre2">something. Everything went black.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Before my sight came back, I heard a voice. I looked around. Everything looked the same as it</span> <span class="calibre2">had moments before. The touch-pad glass thing did, whatever it did whenever sucking us into the</span> <span class="calibre2">thing, and now we stood in the same place?</span></p>
<p id="page_8" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Happy Birthday, Employee! You can begin your shift whenever you want. You might have</span> <span class="calibre2">questions. Such as, what is going on? Where am I? How do I file my W-2? Let’s only address</span> <span class="calibre2">some of those questions.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My head turned to the driver's seat. Mia moved closer to me and squinted at the PDA.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What did that thing do to us?” She asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A new video played. “You work for Future Treats now, Azzzzamy.” The video cut from the ice</span> <span class="calibre2">cream cone to a beach with the waves hitting the sand on a bright day. “You are exactly where</span> <span class="calibre2">you were before you found this device. In the same room, with the same people you love and</span> <span class="calibre2">cherish. You are okay. You are in a completely different identical universe.</span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">You</i></span> <span class="calibre2">have signed up to</span> <span class="calibre2">work for Future Treats. Who are we? We deliver food whenever you want it. How does 'Future</span> <span class="calibre2">Treats' provide our great service? Without causing complications to the space-time continuum?</span> <span class="calibre2">Let me tell you. Because we care, we cannot offer our service within our universe. You can</span> <span class="calibre2">imagine why this might be a bad idea. But luckily, with your help, we can offer our service to a</span> <span class="calibre2">select few universes. Or dimensions if that makes more sense to you. Now, are you calm?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“No!” We both exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Perfect. For a fun explanation, here is a scientist from our company.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The hell is all this? Identical universe?” Mia asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">An ice cream scoop hand puppet appeared against a basic textured blue wall. A woman spoke in</span> <span class="calibre2">a lower ridiculous voice. “You like video games, don’t you? Well, imagine you got a high score</span> <span class="calibre2">and you’re ready to move onto the next level! The “game” auto-saves your progress into a file.</span> <span class="calibre2">Sometimes, for unknown reasons, this file can get saved into multiple copies. If you open any of</span> <span class="calibre2">these files, they play. You have all your items, and nothing major has changed. Think of this</span> <span class="calibre2">dimension you are in now like one of those save files. It’s a copy of the dimension you used to</span> <span class="calibre2">live in. You might notice a few anomalies, but let’s not freak! At Future Treats, we care. So, let’s</span> <span class="calibre2">pause a second, and think about what we learned!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why is the puppet talking so much? I don’t like it.” Mia said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">To my horror, the puppet went on. “You're in one of these dimensional “save files” right now!</span> <span class="calibre2">This isn’t a game, this is real. So please read the employee standards of conduct so you won't get</span> <span class="calibre2">yourself hurt! We wouldn’t want that. Remember, you signed a waiver!”</span></p>
<p id="page_9" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The video changed to a wide shot of the lady with the puppet. She laughed and took the puppet</span> <span class="calibre2">off her hand. She spoke in a normal voice. The older woman had reddish-gray hair and laughed a</span> <span class="calibre2">bit before talking next.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The dimension you are in is safe. Other than the risks you, and all your party, agreed to when</span> <span class="calibre2">you signed your contract. There is nothing you can do here that is going to mess up any</span> <span class="calibre2">timelines, realities, or any of that. Everything has been safeguarded for us. Now. You might ask.</span> <span class="calibre2">Could I go back in time and kill Hitler as a child? Yes, if you can find an order from back then I</span> <span class="calibre2">suppose, but you have fast food to deliver! If you choose to start your shift, you have 8 hours to</span> <span class="calibre2">take deliveries, at your convenience. At the end of the 8 hours, you might get to go home with all</span> <span class="calibre2">the money you earned. If you don’t want to work, that is okay too! We have another you on shift</span> <span class="calibre2">who is willing to work! If you choose not to take deliveries, please enjoy our time travel ‘PDA’.</span> <span class="calibre2">At the end of those eight hours in the shift, you could return to this exact moment in your own</span> <span class="calibre2">universe. If you still have questions, you can ask them then. Remember. We care.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I saw a box on the device's screen prompting me to “Please agree”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Is this a joke?” Mia asked. “We’re in a different dimension?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Are you doing this? Did you set this up?” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“No! I have no idea what’s going on. Why would you say that?” She said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I stammered. “I-I don’t know.”</span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">Why did I say that? Mia never plays pranks on me. Why did I</i></span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">question her like that?</i></span> <span class="calibre2">“I didn’t mean it. I don’t know what any of this means. ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t blame you for stuff.” She exclaimed. “It sounds like you got signed up for something.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What am I supposed to do with this?” I looked down at the PDA.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We gotta get back to my house soon.” She shifted gears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Wait. If this is a job. Do you think it pays well?” I asked, raising my eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She grunted, turning the steering wheel. “I need to talk to my mom about this. She’ll know what</span> <span class="calibre2">to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I turned to her. “Didn’t the video say this is an identical dimension or something? Wouldn’t that</span> <span class="calibre2">mean that’s not your mom? It’s. One of your moms?”</span></p>
<p id="page_10" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I mean,” She said. I could see her thinking. “It’s still my mom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Maybe we shouldn’t tell her we got put in an identical dimension for some time travel fast food</span> <span class="calibre2">job? She’s not going to believe us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That was that one day. She doesn’t always act like that, she takes stuff out on people like I do,”</span> <span class="calibre2">Mia explained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“So she’d be okay with knowing we’ve been hanging out?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia glanced then shook her head. She turned up the volume of the birthday tape mix. We</span> <span class="calibre2">listened to the bumps in the road along with wailing guitars and screaming vocals.</span></p>
