<p id="page_11" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Episode 2 Don’t Slam the Door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Neither of us talked until the van pulled up into the open garage. We parked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia whispered. “Close your door very, very quietly. Don’t slam it. Mom can hear like, a mouse</span> <span class="calibre2">whispering prayers from close up. Don’t make any noise above</span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">this level</i></span> <span class="calibre2">of a whisper. If she</span> <span class="calibre2">doesn’t hear us, she’s not going to wake up. And I don’t have to explain stuff tonight. We can</span> <span class="calibre2">sneak you out in the morning before she wakes up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I’m like “Why is the mouse praying? Why can your mom hear them? Who are they praying to?</span> <span class="calibre2">Are there cheese gods who demand sacrifices?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She told me that wasn’t the point, and told me again not to slam my door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She got out of the van quietly as she could and snuck across the concrete floor. She reached for a</span> <span class="calibre2">rope attached to the top and pulled it all the way, closing the garage. Without making a sound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Proud, she turned to me. “Nailed it.” She whispered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">SLAM.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She looked at me in horror. I looked back, also in horror. My mouth hung open. “I was thinking.</span> <span class="calibre2">Don’t slam the door so hard that I slammed the door. I am so sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Stomping her foot and stretching out her fingers in anger she said. “I asked you to do one thing!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“One is a hard number! I messed up, I’m sorry,” I replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Apology loop!” She said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">From the kitchen entrance of the garage, Ms. Kaye rushed out. She turned on a single light. She</span> <span class="calibre2">stood in her black nightgown looking hard and confused. We stood covered in paint.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Mia? Is that you?” She asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia rolled her eyes. “No Mom, I’m Dumbledore. I’m here to solve all your problems for you.”</span> <span class="calibre2">She shook her head as if that were the dumbest question ever.</span></p>
<p id="page_12" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kaye’s face got angry red. I know that look on a mom’s face. I should have stopped myself</span> <span class="calibre2">from letting her pick me up from the park. She shouldn’t be hanging around me. This is why I</span> <span class="calibre2">don't deserve to have happiness. Why can't I get out of my way?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m sorry!” I said, hyperventilating.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia turned to me. “Apology loop!” She turned to her mom, rolling her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah Mom, I picked up a hooker, bought some blow, and joined a cult too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kaye looked at me. And sighed. “Are you the cult leader or the hooker?” She said to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia put a hand on my shoulder, since my knees were shaking and my face must have looked like</span> <span class="calibre2">a fish out of water trying to breathe. “Maybe both?” She said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kaye took a couple of steps toward us. “You don’t have a license, Mia!” Her left eye</span> <span class="calibre2">twitched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I gasped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia shrugged. “If someone was ever home to take me to get the test, I’d have one.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kaye is like, “Mia Serenity. What is going on? Why is. Aurore here? Close to one oclock in</span> <span class="calibre2">the morning?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We looked at each other, hoping the other one would know what to do. But of course, I’m stupid</span> <span class="calibre2">and can’t I think of anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia shook her hands at me in a strangling gesture after not saying something. “ Bicana will</span> <span class="calibre2">figure out the van is gone. I went looking for Aurore at the park and found a glow party going</span> <span class="calibre2">on. Someone gave them a package with a futuristic PDA. Strange stuff happened. A puppet told</span> <span class="calibre2">us we were in an identical dimension, here to deliver fast food.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My hands shook as I reached out to show the PDA to Ms. Kaye. She looked at it. Tired.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Nice palm pilot.” Ms. Kay closed her eyes and let out a deep sigh. “Identical dimension? This is</span> <span class="calibre2">what you came up with to tell me? Out of all the things you could have picked. It’s identical</span> <span class="calibre2">dimension fast food? Do you think I’m stupid?”</span></p>
<p id="page_13" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">On the futuristic device, I looked at the apps, trying to find some way to show Ms. Kay the</span> <span class="calibre2">employee video that we saw. But the video was gone. I couldn't find it. The phone had a weird</span> <span class="calibre2">setup that made it super hard to find anything. Mia looked at me. I shook my head. “I can’t find</span> <span class="calibre2">the video. It said there would be an eight-hour shift. Then we’d get to return to when the shift</span> <span class="calibre2">started or something.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kaye stepped towards the kitchen door. “What is happening is you are going to bed. I am</span> <span class="calibre2">calling Aurore’s mother to come to pick up the identical dimension traveler.” Ms. Kay looked at</span> <span class="calibre2">me. “What’s your number?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know what my number is.” Which is true. I didn’t bother to memorize my house</span> <span class="calibre2">number. What was I going to do calling my house anyways? Check on the answering machine to</span> <span class="calibre2">see if the house was lonely? My mom would never pick up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kaye walked over to me. I held my breath. She took something sticking out of my hoodie,</span> <span class="calibre2">taking a flier I had stuffed in my math book. I had forgotten about our school's parent meet-up</span> <span class="calibre2">event. My mom was supposed to bring punch, and contact another student's parents about</span> <span class="calibre2">dessert, but she didn’t make it out to the meeting. Ms. Kay found my name, and put her finger</span> <span class="calibre2">under my home phone number. She walked to the kitchen and picked up the receiver on the wall.</span> <span class="calibre2">She fingers punched in some numbers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“She won’t answer,” I followed her inside. My hands fell flat on the counter beside Ms. Kay.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Mom, stop.” Mia stood near the refrigerator covered in envelopes marked “Bills”. Held on by</span> <span class="calibre2">those magnetic things. They were all unpaid.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Let’s get everyone home.” Ms. Kaye huffed, waiting as the phone rang.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Cue to tragedy, for the first time, my ‘other’ mom answered the phone. I was doomed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Sorry to call so late Ms. Chandler. Aurore is here and—” She paused. Ms. Kaye turned to me as</span> <span class="calibre2">my mom spoke, slurring her words over the receiver. She couldn’t stop looking at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She knew.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I listened. She listened. My mom had told her something. I lowered my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You should drink some water.” She hung up the phone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia hesitated, before asking, “What did she say?”</span></p>
<p id="page_14" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kaye turned away from us. She spoke. “That Aurore can spend the night. I’ll drive you both</span> <span class="calibre2">to school in the morning. Does that handheld device tell you when your “shift” starts? Is it going</span> <span class="calibre2">to interfere with the math class you’re failing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m not talking to you… Nevermind. How about you both go to sleep…” Ms. Kaye turned back</span> <span class="calibre2">to talk to us. Instead, she saw me grabbing something from the top cabinet. I poured coffee into</span> <span class="calibre2">Mia’s favorite cup. The one with the emo llama. I handed it to her. And then I realized what I</span> <span class="calibre2">did. We looked up at her, together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“How do you know where the coffee cups were, Aurore?” She asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I didn’t answer… I took a sip of coffee, hoping she wouldn’t notice me wide-eyed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She shook her head. “Go study, and if you're worried about whatever this PDA time thing is, we</span> <span class="calibre2">can deal with it later. There's leftover pizza in the fridge if you want it. I only have 40 bucks left</span> <span class="calibre2">so that might be it for a while. I’ll call my sister in the morning. I’m going to bed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Thanks, Mom,” Mia walked further into the house and turned back to look at me. Ms. Kaye</span> <span class="calibre2">went back to her bedroom, closing the door. I stood there. Confused.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She knows what’s up. She’s like “No one is in trouble. We yell it out sometimes. Come on.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m used to like, fighting with fits and stuff. This is all weird to me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She almost smiled. But she sounded annoyed. “Get used to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We brought the pizza slices up the stairs to her room, on a plate hot from the microwave. Mia sat</span> <span class="calibre2">on the floor next to me. After using a napkin to wipe neon paint off our faces, she took a slice of</span> <span class="calibre2">pizza. Her lips twisted before taking a bite and saying. “How can you work for a company you</span> <span class="calibre2">didn’t sign up for? How is that like, legal?” She looked as hungry as I was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I nodded. The PDA buzzed. We jumped about a foot away together in shock. She pointed. “Is</span> <span class="calibre2">there a ‘make it not do weird stuff’ button?”</span></p>
<p id="page_15" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Something else on the screen came up. “Take this order now and receive a two-thousand-dollar</span> <span class="calibre2">bonus! Coffee delivery.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My eyes went to the order details. “Two thousand dollars? I can make two thousand dollars by</span> <span class="calibre2">delivering coffee? I could find a place to live, and eat, couldn't I?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“For a month. That’s about how much my mom pays in rent for this place. I know this address,</span> <span class="calibre2">that’s Lost Coffee. We’re always at Lost Coffee. Order sixty-six. We could pick the order before</span> <span class="calibre2">school tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Your mom pays two thousand a month? About? For this house?” I asked, in shock.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She nodded. “If you include utilities, yeah. She pays a lot.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We don’t know what this is. What if this is some kind of… Scam. The video did have a</span> <span class="calibre2">puppet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“But if there are more jobs like that,” Mia said. “We could make some real money. Maybe my</span> <span class="calibre2">mom could take some time off if we could help out. Did you see all those bills on the fridge?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I kept reading on the screen the “Two thousand dollars”. I didn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Of course you don’t want to do anything.” Mia blurted. “You never want to do anything to</span> <span class="calibre2">make your situation better.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“There’s so much about this thing we don’t know!” My fingertip glided over the glass screen. “I</span> <span class="calibre2">don’t think we should risk whatever this is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She looked hurt at this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m not going to mess us up this time.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She never answered that. She wanted to say something else. But didn’t.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">It had been hard to sleep after drinking so much coffee and with so much excitement. But we laid</span> <span class="calibre2">close together for a few hours, with the window cracked, listening to my CD player skip every</span> <span class="calibre2">minute or so. Still laying on the floor. Because we are floor people. She had the right earbud, I</span> <span class="calibre2">had the left. We both listened to the same CD on repeat until we fell asleep, and the sun came up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p id="page_16" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I wake up cold at the Kaye house because of how low Mia liked to keep the thermostat. She</span> <span class="calibre2">wraps herself in blankets by the time the sun rises. After staying there for a while until she can</span> <span class="calibre2">bear to get up and face the day. I used this time to go downstairs to make coffee until she calms</span> <span class="calibre2">down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">After she and I first started hanging out, we’d always start fighting first thing in the morning. I’m</span> <span class="calibre2">the grumpy one; she’s an angry wild bear the entire time. She threw a spoon at me one time. That</span> <span class="calibre2">meant to stop talking. We started following a “morning depression checklist”. It’s our routine of</span> <span class="calibre2">coffee and panicking. Things got better. Kind of.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">That morning, after showering and borrowing some of Mia’s clothes, Ms. Kaye drove us to Lost</span> <span class="calibre2">Coffee in her expensive Mustang. The place was close to our school and didn’t have as much</span> <span class="calibre2">traffic. I fumed over having to carry around that PDA. I couldn’t leave the thing in Mia’s room.</span> <span class="calibre2">But what was I supposed to do with that the whole day, keep it in my pocket? What’s the point?</span> <span class="calibre2">The device uses the internet without having to dialing up, which is cool I guess, but I could just</span> <span class="calibre2">walk to a computer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We went to get out of the car, and I was like, “Bye Ms. Kaye!” real fast and stuff. But she said</span> <span class="calibre2">“Aurore, can I talk to you for a moment? Alone?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I bet my face looked like someone had asked me to tap dance on steak knives or something. I</span> <span class="calibre2">mouthed to Mia. “Save me.” Then I remembered she couldn’t read lips. And that Ms. Kay totally</span> <span class="calibre2">could see me mouthing stuff. Mia stood there squinting at me confused, trying to figure out what</span> <span class="calibre2">I was saying.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m getting you an Americano.” She shook her head and headed into the neon building. I sat</span> <span class="calibre2">alone in the left back seat, behind Ms. Kaye who stopped the “Aurore’s birthday” mixtape. She</span> <span class="calibre2">let out a deep breath as if relieved. The sadness of the music hurt her or something. She pulled</span> <span class="calibre2">out the tape and examined the label.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Oh.” She said. “Is this tape yours?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I gulped. “Yeah. Mia made it for me today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Happy Birthday.” She said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I sat frozen, unable to speak. I tried to say something that sounded like “Smanks.” but my</span> <span class="calibre2">mumbling words drowned out halfway through saying it. I nodded a few times instead. That</span> <span class="calibre2">seemed to be enough for her. She also nodded.</span></p>
<p id="page_17" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The seats smelled clean. That’s what I remember thinking trying not to think. I’m always finding</span> <span class="calibre2">new ways to do that. I asked her, “Is this about the confetti in the room last night? I can explain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">There was a long pause before she spoke to me again. She sat gripping the steering wheel with</span> <span class="calibre2">both hands. She thought a while before saying, “I’m not sure which dimension we are in. But in</span> <span class="calibre2">whichever dimension you find yourself, you can stay with us.” She informed me, “Money is</span> <span class="calibre2">tight. It’s bad actually. Really bad. I don’t know how much I can help you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Squirming in my seat, I exclaimed “I can look for a job.” It dawned on me. My fingers glided</span> <span class="calibre2">over the PDA in my pocket “I. Oh. I have a job, I can help you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You mean the palm pilot you found last night?” She blinked a couple of long blinks. She turned</span> <span class="calibre2">around in the driver's seat to face me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Some of the orders on the PDA are for a lot of money. It’s a real job, I think.” I showed the</span> <span class="calibre2">amount to her. Her left eye closed, and her head tilted sideways.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Something about this all seems. Off.” She glanced sideways. “You sure this thing isn’t going to</span> <span class="calibre2">start asking you to take your clothes off or something?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I reached for the door handle. “I will never take my clothes off for money, Ms. Kaye.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You know what I wish someone would have taught me, Rore?” She reached for her purse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">In case you didn’t know, Aurore is a confusing name my mom picked for me because it sounded</span> <span class="calibre2">cool. A lot of people don’t know the “re” at the end is silent. So, the teachers and other kids</span> <span class="calibre2">would call me “Auro-re” or “Rory.” for short back in Junior High. I don’t like to be called that</span> <span class="calibre2">anymore, but I was not going to correct her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I wish someone would have told me to not owe anything to anybody. I haven’t made a sale in</span> <span class="calibre2">months.” She seemed to reflect on the thought. Her face got weird like that wasn’t something I</span> <span class="calibre2">was supposed to know.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She went on, “Make sure Mia finds a pay phone and checks in with me after school, I’ll be at the</span> <span class="calibre2">office. Might have to fly back to Chicago tonight.” She rubbed her eyes then handed me two</span> <span class="calibre2">twenty-dollar bills from her purse. “She’s going to jump without looking someday. I know</span> <span class="calibre2">because I live out of a suitcase for most days of the year. Away from my family. That’s how I got</span> <span class="calibre2">here. With you around, maybe she’ll think twice. About. Doing Mia things. ”</span></p>
<p id="page_18" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I. she. Err. Ms. Kaye? She’s. My. I’d never leave her behind. You can trust me. I’m stable.”</span> <span class="calibre2">Ms.Kaye grabbed my shirt as I went to get out of the Mustang. I flinched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Wait.” She said, loosening her grip after seeing my mini freak out. “Did you see that person?</span> <span class="calibre2">They are stumbling inside. I should go in with you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I can throw down,” I lowered my raised eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She gave me a death glare. She leaned towards the steering wheel, tapping her fingers. “Throw</span> <span class="calibre2">down?” She remembered ‘The fight.’ from Jr. High, the one where all the counselors and</span> <span class="calibre2">therapists got involved.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I… Got to go study math Ms. Kaye. We got a test this morning.” I got out of that Mustang so</span> <span class="calibre2">fast. I slammed the door and ran inside the coffee shop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Be careful,” I heard her say behind me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I found Mia waiting in the back of the coffee shop, collecting pillows from the other eight retro</span> <span class="calibre2">sofas lining the outer walls of the shop. People sat drinking coffee in large black mugs. The</span> <span class="calibre2">purple and light blue tubes lit the place, casting shadows on the register on the L shape counter.</span> <span class="calibre2">The aroma of roasted coffee beans and indie books lingered in the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I walked past all the college students sitting cross legged on the floor reading weird poetry aloud,</span> <span class="calibre2">and sat next to Mia on the sofa. She reached over and put a pillow between me and the armrest.</span> <span class="calibre2">Beethoven played over the store’s speakers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She handed me the americano. The drink didn’t last long, as I swallowed the whole thing in</span> <span class="calibre2">about 20 seconds. I placed my empty mug next to her’s on the coffee table.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You watched me freaking out the whole time from in here didn’t you?” I asked Mia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah, that was intense. What she say to you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I sneered, pulling up the PDA. Mia bumped her hips into mine, moving closer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What did she say?”</span></p>
<p id="page_19" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m staying with you. If I can help pay some stuff off. We are taking this shift and giving your</span> <span class="calibre2">mom the money. And she also told me you spilled sour milk in my locker.” I glimpsed at an</span> <span class="calibre2">abstract painting of a crow pecking at a cucumber on the wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I took the job on the device. “Shift Begins! You have 8 hours to take orders. At the end of the</span> <span class="calibre2">shift, you might return to your dimension. Good luck, worker! We care.” It chimed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“She’s letting you stay with us?” Mia asked. Shocked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“... In this dimension? I guess?” I asked. Feeling as if I had slammed the door of the van again,</span> <span class="calibre2">by not asking her if it was okay.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She leaned over and hugged me. Pressing her forehead into my waist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What are you doing?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m having a moment,” She let go of me and sat back up before fidgeting with a pillow not</span> <span class="calibre2">sitting flush behind her. “Shut up. We’re going to figure this all out. This life stuff. Aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah,” I let my head rest on hers. “I’m not messing it up this time.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I tapped on ‘Confirm.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Now that your shift has started, you can take an order!” It said, “These orders are from regular</span> <span class="calibre2">customers who want a good old treat from the past. Don’t forget to smile, and don’t forget to say</span> <span class="calibre2">the Future Treats motto! Our Motto is…” The speakers crackled and hissed. I held the device</span> <span class="calibre2">away from my body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“And we’re going to buy your van from your aunt.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She hugged me again. Which completely threw me off, cause this hugging usually wasn’t a</span> <span class="calibre2">thing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Not after too long, a woman in her early thirties covered in awesome tattoos walked to the</span> <span class="calibre2">counter. She called out order sixty-six. I hugged Mia tighter before getting up to grab the drink.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s mine.” The stumbling drunk Ms. Kaye saw out in the parking lot stood in front of me.</span> <span class="calibre2">They wore a red tie and a wrinkled white button-down dress shirt. They looked old. Burned out.</span> <span class="calibre2">Like they had been hit by a train about 20 times but somehow lived through it.</span></p>
<p id="page_20" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s not your coffee, kid.” They said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It says it’s my order on my PDA.” I held up the device. The stranger held something of their</span> <span class="calibre2">own. Their device said:</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Authenticated.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I backed away, turning to Mia, who squinted at the stranger in the store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What did you do?” I asked them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The familiar looking person ran to the counter and grabbed my coffee. Mia stood closer next to</span> <span class="calibre2">me, now holding a sofa pillow ready to fight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What are you doing? Why? Would you you take her?” The stranger asked, drooping their</span> <span class="calibre2">shoulders. How did they know who Mia was? They went on. “I could throw this, you know. I’m</span> <span class="calibre2">being nice to you. Which is nice of me after what YOU did to me.” The drunk took a few more</span> <span class="calibre2">steps back. They were moving towards the exit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What did I do to you? I don’t know you,” I put my hands in my pockets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why do you think I look like you?” They hissed. I peered into their familiar eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Other people in the coffee shop turned to us and watched us argue. The cool goth lady waved her</span> <span class="calibre2">hand. “Whatever this is, get it outside and away from here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The drunk shook their head. "I. Am you. From 20 years in the future. From another dimension.</span> <span class="calibre2">But you should know that by now. Look. We got off on the wrong foot here. Let’s all go talk</span> <span class="calibre2">things out. I have some hard things to say to you, but I’m going to set you right. I know a great</span> <span class="calibre2">margarita place in 2019 with some cheap specials.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My heart sank. I couldn’t believe what I heard. I’m like “I don’t drink. I’m eighteen! You’re</span> <span class="calibre2">joking with me, right? You don’t. We don’t. Drink.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Thinking about their offer brought a random mental image of my mom into my head. Her</span> <span class="calibre2">rummaging through the fridge for one last can of beer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The other me started patting their pockets with their other hand. As if they were searching for</span> <span class="calibre2">something. “I have an ID that says you are of age. It’s not even fake. Give me your phone and</span> <span class="calibre2">it’s yours.”</span></p>
<p id="page_21" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia grabbed my clenched hand. “Breathe,” She said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The stranger went on. “Can you stop being a sad little emo kid for five seconds little Azami? I</span> <span class="calibre2">got things to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My jaw clenched. “That was on the package. Are… Are you calling us A-zam-ee now? Like you</span> <span class="calibre2">think that’s a name normal people use?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What are you saying? Azami! I changed my name to Azami.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I’m like “Umm. Why?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Because you suck, and I want nothing to do with you. You’re dumb. I’m getting out of here.”</span> <span class="calibre2">They tightened their empty hands. But the to-go cup they thought they were holding was gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Run!” I yelled to Mia, holding the coffee. We dashed out of the store. A-zam-ee ran after us but</span> <span class="calibre2">gave up. Instead, they raised their middle finger at us as we ran towards Fremont street.</span></p>
