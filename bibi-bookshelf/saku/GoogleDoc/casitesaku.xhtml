        Episode One

    </h1>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Sakura Tomodachi had spent the morning by the river, filling a silo with buckets of river water. The other villagers had worked for weeks on an irrigation system to help with the recent drought but had run into problems with some of the local wildlife. So they elected the poor Saku to fill up the wooden water bin while the others kept the area safe. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m tired of this. Curse the conquerors.” Saku said to herself. Her hands were cold from the river but her face was warm from a heat not expected in a coastal village. She looked to the top of the foothill at the container, relieved that the work was almost complete. By the next day all the water would be gone, sent off in bamboo tubes to the thirsty green tea plants on the slopes below. Then she’d start out the next morning, refilling the bin. Until told otherwise, that would be her life. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“If you think you are tired now, I have bad news.” A voice came from behind Saku. A woman approached, wearing a dark cloak complete with a quiver of arrows and a long black stained bow that hung on her shoulders. She squinted into the sun at the water silo. “And be thankful the conquerors took over, and stopped us from eating those crazy blossoms. Can you imagine if we all still wandered around talking to those dead things all the time?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Easy for you to say, Mibu.” Saku pressed and cooled her forehead with her still cold hands. “You haven’t had to carry water up the mountain all morning.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu shook her head. “No, I haven’t. I’ve been on duty on the outskirts. Defending the village. Actually doing something that was asked of us.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span>Saku’s muscles ached as she lifted the bucket and walked back up the hill. “</span>
      <span class="c12">I am doing something</span>
      <span>. I told you I’ve been taking water up, like they </span>
      <span>asked of me</span>
      <span> yesterday.” She shook her head. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You did, I could see you from my post, filling the wrong silo.” Mibu ’s upper lip rose for an instant but flattened. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They said fill up the west water silo by evening!” Saku cried. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They did.” Mibu crossed her arms. “And now the east water silo is filled and ready when the next season's tea crops. But the west silo is unfilled.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “You’re joking Mibu. That way is west. You’re having fun with me.” Saku pointed at the silo. “Wait. No. The sun is in the wrong place. I filled up the wrong one, didn't I?”
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        Mibu pointed.  
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “You need to hurry.” She said, playfully.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c12">Whack</span>
      <span class="c1">. Cold water splashed on her bare feet. Having been too deep in thought, Saku discovered she had unknowingly dumped all the water from inside the bucket onto the thirsty ground. She cursed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu bent over laughing. “You didn’t think once to check to make sure you were going to the right one? Oh Saku.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She tried to calculate how long it would take to fill the silo, counting on her fingers as if that would give her an answer. It did not.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I don’t believe in thinking.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu uncrossed her arms. “Come on. Let’s get this filled.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I thought you were on duty?” Saku asked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu grabbed an empty bucket and dipped it into the waters. She gave Saku a look that made her feel uneasy. “I was until I saw you headed up the wrong side of the mountain. I’m here to do your job. Again.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Of course.” Her eyes wandered in the direction of their village, Fukui. “Why can’t I do anything right?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        Mibu placed a hand on her shoulder. “I’m used to you disappointing me. It is my curse. It could be worse. Rusu could have seen you. We are lucky to have one of our own in charge who takes it easy on us. You remember what Yataku’s people used to do to workers who made mistakes? Or. Knew about people like us?” 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The memories flashed before Saku’s eyes, memories she did not like to dwell on. She also didn’t like being called a curse. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Come on.”Mibu went on. “We need to finish before the gathering tonight, before anyone finds out I left my post. Rusu’s would really be ticked off if she knew that.”
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Gathering? Why are we having a gathering? Is this about the drought?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Oh Saku.” Mibu said, shaking her head. She sighed before walking past carrying two buckets. “ It’s been talked about for weeks. I know not. But all of Fukui is summoned.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You think they’d miss me if I didn’t show up?” Saku refilled the container and ran up the hill to meet her. Something caught her foot, and the next thing Saku knew she had fallen and was feeling wet dirt on her face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Don’t worry. I will always protect you. You’re the best… sparring partner ever. Though, If you keep spilling water we’re never going to finish. And someone is going to find out.” She said, helping Saku to her feet.    </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I will make it up to you. Someday. Somehow.” Saku said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">– </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">After completing the task, which with the help of Mibu was much quicker, they made their way to the temple in the middle of the village. Some others still dressed in their working clothes came out of their longhouses, the roofs covered with dying grass. The two noticed that the people had already gathered. Rusu looked at both of them walking in late. Her eyes narrowed at them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They didn’t say what this was about?” Saku asked Mibu, looking into one of the longhouses. In the middle was a garden with a shriveled tree.  People used to grow their own food in the old days, keeping their own crops. But lately no one had been able to grow much. It’s hard to grow crops in dust.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Do they ever tell us anything, Saku? Why is Rusu looking at us?” Mibu said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They tell us to work faster, and not to have feelings.” Saku sneered. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Other than that. I think we are in trouble.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">They passed the dry pond under the giant arch, joining the others near one of the older shrines. After they had taken their place, Rusu nodded at them. She then addressed the crowd next to a cherry tree, whose blossoms looked withered. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“This morning came word from Shao Song. They informed me they have increased their tea and rice tax. And have doubled their tribute demand. We will need to quicken our pace if we wish to meet this. We need to minimize our mistakes, like making sure we deliver things to the correct place.” Rusu said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku heard a few laughs. Mibu’s eyes widened. Others began to bicker aloud. Saku raised her voice. “Double? The amount of tea they want is ridiculous! Don’t they drink anything else?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu gave a friendly but firm jab to Saku’s ribs. “Stop speaking, we are in danger.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Rusu’s eyes caught Saku’s. “Your attachment to Mibu seems. Unnatural.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Our business is our own.” Saku said, feeling the villagers' eyes turned upon them. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’re still talking.” Mibu said, hitting Saku a second time in the ribs. “You’re going to get both of us…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“The conquerors have requested a shipment of the forbidden tea be brought to the city as soon as possible. Lord Yataku is hosting a grand meeting to calm relations with other lords in the land. As you know, the others who have been sent on this task. Did not return. I feel like this is a good job for you, Mibu.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku’s hand caught Mibu’s as she tried to hit her again for speaking. Saku threw her hand aside. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No! I will go!” Saku said, stepping forward. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Laughter erupted. Some people clapped. Saku stood, looking into Mibu’s light brown eyes. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Let me go with her.” Mibu said, turning in a panic back towards the speaker. “Let me guard her to ensure that…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No.” Rusu said. “Maybe that is one job Saku can do correctly. You are to depart tomorrow after the sixth morning bell.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Please! She doesn’t know what she’s doing, I will go!” Mibu shouted. But all of the villagers left, leaving the two behind alone. She kicked at the dirt ground. “We need to get out of here. Tonight.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No.” Saku said. “You know what happens to those who try to leave. The conquerors find them, everytime. I must travel to Shao Song, alone. This is the only way our village will ever accept us for who we are. Maybe others will start seeing how unfair living like this is.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“It doesn’t matter if this is fair, Saku. This is just the way it has to be. If we want to keep living. And speaking out only makes it worse.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We’re supposed to do what then? Working harder, and keep living on less and less?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We have to do what we need to do to keep on going. That is the only choice. That is why we should leave. If anything ever happened to you I’d never be able to forgive myself…” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Weren’t we meant for more, Mibu?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We’re meant to grow the conqueror's tea. That is all.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Then I will prove to you, that you are meant for more.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu hung her head. “Stay safe. And when in doubt, don’t say anything. Please. Come back.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’ll be back.” Saku said. “I’ll show everyone. I’ll even bring you back something from the markets you always tell me about.”  She smiled. But Mibu did not.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">*** </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The next morning, six bells rang echoing throughout the dusty hills. Saku gathered the rest of her meager rice rations and returned to the temple. To her surprise no one greeted her in the small closed off structure. The rowhouse was usually guarded but not that morning. She entered, seeing a large grass woven pack overstuffed with what she assumed was the forbidden tea. However, this kind Saku had not seen before. Most of the villagers had not seen this before. Only special handlers were allowed to prepare the flower petals in that location using ingredients sent from Shao Song. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She knew she should have made some travel rice balls the night before for the day long journey. But after carrying water all day her back and forearms throbbed with soreness. She hadn’t felt like cooking. Rice is also used as money, and she knew if she wanted to buy anything in the markets she would have to eat light. At least she would not have to carry water for the next few days, being able to stop along the rivers along the way. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The bag was so heavy and overfilled Saku buckled at the knees when placing it on her back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s a lot of tea.” She found herself chuckling at the insane amount of rich scented petals. So much that none of them were even allowed to drink. She thought about what she had heard about her people in the past, and about how the conquerors had banned the flowers that turned them mad. The villagers were known to carry skulls around all day. They weren’t allowed to talk about those times anymore, not out in the open at least. It felt strange to her that suddenly she was allowed to not only carry it, but deliver it. She wondered why. The conquerors could drink it without anything happening. Why would they be offering it to other nations? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku looked around the Temple before setting out. The entire village was still covered in thick dust. She pulled at her jacket. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I better get going.” She thought. But then she paused, and looked about. She had no idea which direction Shao Song was in, especially with the dust. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I guess I’ll figure it out.” She said. After a few hours the dust be lifted, and she would see the western mountains and would be able to find the city from there. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">So she set out, not knowing where she was going. Saku had seen Mibu once head to Shao Song on the road outside the temple, so she picked that way and began to walk, hoping she headed in the right direction. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">– </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The dust did not lift after six hours of walking. Though Saku was confident she was still heading in the right direction, for the road still lay under her feet. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Her stomach growled. She knew she would need to stop and prepare something soon, but Shao Song must have been only a few hours away. But she looked down to what she thought was the road, but saw only dirt ground. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What happened to the road?” She said, stomping her feet. She could see nothing but the dust. “Well. I’m doomed. That didn’t take long.”   </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Suddenly, Saku heard a voice behind her. “What are you looking for, stranger?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She quickly turned, and saw a man standing behind her. The dust seemingly lifted around him. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m looking for the village of Shao Song.” She answered. She noticed the man was wearing an outfit that she also had, a dress of a very bright orange color. He had a crazy haircut that looked funny to Saku. “I thought this way would take me there.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’re almost to Shao Song.” The man replied. Saku recognized his dialect to be one of the conquerors. “If you follow me I can take you there. It’s down the road from here. We could be there within the next few hours. All I ask is for a little cooked meal.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m starving.” She said, “If you help me find water I’ll prepare onigiri. Then you’ll take me the rest of the way?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’ll take you the rest of the way.” The stranger agreed, grinning. “What’s that on your back?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Tea.” Saku said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The man took a few steps towards her and smiled. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You are one of those skull people that they keep finding dead, aren’t you?” He said. “I like you.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku began to follow him, having been taught to obey all conquerors orders, but stopped. She looked and asked. “What is your name?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The man turned around and smiled. He held onto the handle of a large katana. “Just call me Ayashi.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">– </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Nearby, she could hear the sounds of a stream. From beneath the dust, a massive tent appeared in front of them. The front and the back of the tent allowed air in and a large side flap allowed entrance. It looked to Saku as if the man lived there. Ayashi took off his katana and placed it inside. She wandered looking at the stream before turning to the firepit in the middle of the encampment. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s a nice sword.” Saku said, pointing at the katana laying now in the tent. “I need one of those if I’m going to be traveling, uh?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Ayashi smirked. “You can’t have this one. I claimed it recently. It is so new that I haven’t even tested it out yet.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku wasn’t listening, she was rummaging in her pack. “You have a pot to cook rice in? I seem to have forgotten my cookware.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">After a few moments Ayashi brought a large pot with a heavy lid, along with a pan. He lit the fire and placed an iron grid over the stone pit. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Get cooking.” He said. “And cook some of these.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">He handed her four large eggs. “What are these?” Saku asked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Duck.” he said. He pointed to a spot near the stream. Their feathers lay, along with the corpse of a bird. It’s bare skull seemed to be looking at Saku. She turned away. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’ll get everything started.” She began to cook. As she did, Ayashi put a kettle filled with river water on the fire.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The rice turned out wet and mushy. Saku prepared the soggy onigiri anyways with the burnt egg inside. Ayashi handed her a black cup made from clay. The liquid inside was so dark she could not see to the bottom. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Drink this.” He said , trying to swallow the food she had prepared.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What is it?” Saku didn’t look before drinking. She had drunk all of it before Ayashi spit the onigiri to the ground. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Let’s call it Sake.” He said, taking another bite. “Wow. That was easy. Now, before we leave I want you to help me test out my katana.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What do I need to do?” Saku sat the empty cup down and leapt to her feet. She stumbled. She felt her eyes grow warm, and her mind began to wander. Before she realized it, she could only focus on the sound of a laughing man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You don’t need to do anything.” He said. It looked like he was walking towards the tent. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What did you do to me?” Saku asked, trying to get control of herself, but Ayashi did not answer. He prepared his weapon for it to be tested. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku tried to regain her footing. Inside her mind thoughts violently began to swirl. Images of her people appeared, but not like some of the old paintings she had once seen that the conquers had destroyed , but real people telling her many things. As hard as she tried she could not grasp what they were saying. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Run!” A voice inside her mind cried. Other voices joined. “Run!!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She realized she couldn't tell what was real anymore. The lines had seemingly blurred after drinking whatever she had drank. She suddenly heard another voice, but this one seemed more real.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They’re telling you to run stupid.” It said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku’s eyes darted in the direction of the voice. It seemed to be coming from the skull of the duck. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Don’t call me an idiot!” Saku said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You don’t have time to argue!” The skull said, “Run!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku ran towards the stream.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Not that way!” The skull cried. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She turned around, but there stood Ayashi with the katana raised. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Let’s see how sharp this is.” He told her. He swung down towards her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She rolled out of the way, barely missing the blade.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Ayashi charged at her again, but she was able to move out of the way. She had no idea what was going on. Laying on the ground, surrounded by chunks of bones, the skull said. “I’m not sure why I’m having to tell you this so much, but run!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She kicked the man’s leg. He dropped the sword. She rolled by the skull, grabbed it, and ran as fast as she could into the forest, without the tea. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">

        <br/>
        “Can you get your hands off my eye holes? I can’t see.” Said the skull in the palm of Saku’s hand. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She dropped it on the forest ground and took a step back, reaching out to take hold of a dark red barked tree covered in moss. Her hands covered her mouth. Partly in shock, and a little because of the fog of dust that still lingered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I don’t like it down here. Pick me up.” The duck skull said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What are you?” Saku bent down, keeping her distance. Voices cried out, from where she did not know. They seemed to be speaking in her mind. She fought to drown out the multitude of voices.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What does it look like I am?” Said the skull. “I’m a duck. And I’m dead. I thought that was easy to follow.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She placed the palms of both hands on her head and dug her fingers through her hair into her scalp. “I must be crazy.” She stood to her feet, before taking a few steps away and shouted “How are you talking?!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“...That’s like asking how are you breathing. Everything dead talks, your people listen and everything is kept in balance. Which, by the way, y’all have done a horrible job with that the past 100 years or so.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We help you out? What are you talking about? That man tricked me!?” She said.</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“The ex-Samurai you were cooking for, like you were married?”</span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That man was a Samurai?” Saku dropped down on her knees to address the talking deceased thing. “The one who wanted to cut me in half all of a sudden?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No, the other one. Duh. Ex masterless Samurai. Ronin. That’s what those crazy people do, go around trying to cut people in half for fun. I think after you’ve killed a couple of hundred people in battle your moral compass goes straight out the window. Along with your sense of fashion.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku blushed. “I have that same dress.”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The skull didn’t reply for a moment. “I said what I said. Why are you acting like this is new to you? You’ve drank that tea before haven’t you? You had your 18th year tea celebration or whatever you do?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We’re not allowed to drink the tea. We haven’t been allowed to for a very long time. It makes us talk to… Wait. That’s why I’m talking to you now isn’t it? You’re responding only in my head.”</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The skull looked at Saku strangely. “...You’re growing tea? Why?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“How am I supposed to get my bag back from that. Torso chopping happy ex-samuri?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Did a skull person, of the ultimate wild magic arts, seriously just ask me how they can defeat an ex-samuri? You ask that like you don’t know you can command undead armies and summon lightning from the sky.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku blinked. She picked the creature back up again. “I’m sorry. What do you think my people can do again?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Are you really a skull person? You don’t sound like it.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Skull. Attack that tree.” Saku pointed at the skinniest weakest tree her eyes could see. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Skull person. No.” It said. “My name is Kamo by the way.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She held Kamo in her hands, checking its eye holes. “See Kamo? I can’t command undead armies or shoot lightning from my eyes. I’m a normal person.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Of course you can’t shoot lightning out of your eyes, that would be silly. I said you can shoot lightning from the sky.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku turned Kamo back in the direction of Ayashi’s camp. “If I don’t get that tea delivered, I don’t know what the conquerors are going to do. To me or my village.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">If Kamo could have roll his eyes he would have. “Maybe one of them in your village can call on the wild for aid? Someone who knows what they are doing?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Maybe this craziness will wear off. And soon I’ll just be holding a dead duck skull, feeling silly yet gross about myself. I’m going to leave you here. And go wash my hands.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Dudes gonna drink your tea if you don’t go do something.” Kamo said. “And you need my help. Don’t leave me down here, I can’t walk, I have no legs, Saku”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She sighed. “I can’t. You aren’t real.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I am very real. Take me along and let me prove it to you. When the tea doesn’t wear off, and you realize the things you can do, you are going to want me. And if I stop talking? Then you can leave me.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She thought of what everyone would think if somehow someone back in the village knew what had happened. Memories of other people from Fukui not coming back, or even worse the times the conquers had made strung up the bodies of those who were unable to do their duties as assigned came to her mind.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I don’t have a choice.” She said. “I’m going to prove I can do things without Mibu. I will take you with me. For now. Until I find someone who can cure of this. Tea illness or whatever is going on right now. I’ll find a way to fight Ayashi long enough to grab the bag. All without letting the people in the castle know where I am.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She carried Kamo in her arms towards the camp.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You didn’t even bring a weapon?” He said. Saku didn’t reply. “Yikes. Better grab a stick or something.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She held the skull close to her face and narrowed her eyes. </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        <br/>
        From up on a hill that towered above the treetops, Saku looked down on the camp. The fire had been put out and the flap of the tent had been closed. She held out the skull so that it could see, feeling completely silly while doing it, but Kamo complained about being in the pocket for too long.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">After walking down from the hill she carefully crept towards the camp, dust swirling in the air above her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“He must be asleep or something.” She whispered to the skull in her pocket.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Stop talking before he hears you.” The skull said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She heard a snap. She threw Kamo in the direction the sound had come from. His face slid in the dirt until he once again was facing her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Hey!!!!” He shouted, with a twinge of hurt in his voice. “I may be dead. But my feelings aren’t yet. I am not a weapon!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You had it coming.” Her eyes darted around, back to the tent. As if she expected him to come out of it. He didn’t. After a few moments she went to Kamo and picked him up again. “He’s gone.” She said, still looking around. “Why would he leave?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku carefully approached the tent, and slowly opened the flap. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The skull screamed. Saku dropped the cover. Then paused and slowly turned. Kamo might have been smiling if he had lips instead of a bone beak. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You fell for that?” Kamo asked. “You scare easily.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku threw the skull into the soft dirt. After, she noticed all the items that had once been inside the tent were now gone. Including the tea. But the katana lay in the middle, seemingly waiting for her.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She approached the sword and knelt down. “Why would Ayashi leave his this? That man is crazy, Kamo.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Not as crazy ugly as that dress he was wearing.” He said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I'm telling you I have the same dress. Why does a duck even have an opinion on what I wear? How are we supposed to find Ayashi now? I need to get that tea back. He could be anywhere!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“If you want my advice,” Kamo said. “Burn the dress. That’s not a good color for your skin tone. If you want more of my advice, let’s head to the city. If this Ayashi is as unhinged as he looked, someone will know about him and where he is.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku cursed. “Why do I keep talking to you, you aren’t real. I don’t know how to get to the city. Ayashi said he was going to take me.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“He totally wasn’t going to take you.” Kamo said laughing. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She muttered some unkind words under before saying.  “I know that now! ”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “If I could see the mountains in all this dust, I could point you in the right direction.” Kamo said. “You’re going to Shao Song like this others right? There’s an old lady near an apple tree who used to make great pickles. I used to go to with some of my friends. We’d get up high in the trees so we could see when she was washing her clothes. Then, we’d knock over the clay pots, and enjoy the good eating.”
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Wait, you know how to get to the Shao Song. Because you eat, pickles?” She shook her head. “Yeah you are not real. I am nuts. Mibu can never know I drank the tea. She’d never speak to me again.”
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku turned to look high up at the trees. She put the skull in her pocket and grabbed onto the bark. Soon, she climbed far up enough to reach for sturdy branches. Though sore, she managed to make it to the top. Still the dust covered the sky. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Kamo began complaining about the darkness of the pocket, when Saku grabbed him and tossed him as high into the air as she could. She expected the skull to fall straight down, but she could  see nothing past the leaves of the tree. Suddenly he fell from the dusty air into her vision. She leaned out as far as she could and reached for the skull. Her finger caught his eye hole. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You jerk!” He screamed. “You almost shattered me. Stop dropping me!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m sorry.” She climbed down the tree. “I figured you’d be able to see if I got you up high enough.”  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I did! The mountains are to our left, so we need to keep heading straight up the river. The dust should clear with those wind currents. No more throwing me!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No promises, but I’ll try.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I never expected a skull person to act like this! Have some respect! I shouldn’t have to tell you that!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Well if by some miracle you actually do lead me to Shao Song, and I’m not just standing in the middle of the forest talking to myself, I’ll consider it.” Saku said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She searched around the camp for anything else she might need on her journey but found only a water container. She filled it by the river and headed towards the city. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">–</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        <br/>
        There was no moon that night, and a layer of dust blanketed the horizon. She squinted in the dark and held her hands in front of her as she walked through the forest. Her hand struck a tree at the same time that her knees hit a thorny bush. She cursed. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I can’t see anything. Which means, there’s no city here Kamo. I shouldn’t have listened to you!” Saku shouted at the skull.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Oh? What’s that up ahead?” He said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She noticed the dim lights in the distance. As they approached, the night sky cleared, revealing a city illuminated by scattered, decorated paper lanterns. Banners waved out front of shops, and people in brightly colored kimonos chatted amongst themselves. The scent of cut grass on newly built doors and walls overwhelmed Saku. She had never seen buildings taller than the trees before. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">‘You got lucky.” She told the skull. “All cities are built by water. I’m sure I knew that. This means nothing.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I was right. You have to believe me now.” He said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She held the skull higher towards the shops, still busy with people. “What is everyone doing out so late at night? Don’t they have to work in the morning?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They’re buying stuff?” The skull said. “What, you don’t buy stuff? Maybe from the money you make selling all that tea you spend all day growing?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        <br/>
        Saku suddenly realized others could hear, and see her talking to the skull. She put it away in her upper right pocket. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Hey! I was talking!” The skull said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I can’t keep talking to you.” She whispered. “I’ll look. Not normal.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“So?” The skull said back, Kamo’s voice now sounded muffled through the fabric of Saku’s pocket. “Everyone is crazy in the city. The crazier you are, the more power you have.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“If I get caught…” she began to say. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She noticed a young girl with light brown hair and a patched together blue kimono staring at her.  Saku looked away and whispered. “That kid sees us. If the castle finds out I am here without the tea… Look what you…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The child ran up to Saku and tugged at her pocket. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Is that a talking skull!” The kid said, lifting up on her toes to speak to the foreign person. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “You never talk into your pocket for fun?” Saku tried to hurry away from the child, but she followed her behind a push cart selling dried fish and clay cooked sweet potatoes. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “We don’t have pockets.” The child said. “Are you friends with Oniku?!”  A boy in a old kimono with a blue cap ran to her and used his arm to push the girl back. She swatted away the arm. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Leave her alone, Sister! They don’t like to talk when they’ve not working at the freak show.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku gently squeezed Kamo, as if she were asking him what she should do. Kamo responded, laughing. “Tell her. What’s the worst that can happen? Those people ducklings aren’t going to tell anyone.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        Saku sighed, then smiled slightly at the young girl still filled with excitement. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Okay.” Saku said in a whisper. She put a finger to her lips. “I am Saku, of the pocket people.”
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Tell Oniku she should do more tricks and talk less.” Her brother’s face soured from annoyance. He picked up his sister and carried her over his shoulders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“But I wanted one of those skull flowers they were selling!” She said. The boy did not respond and kept walking. She waved to Saku. She waved back the boy stopped in the middle of the street. Someone was coming. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span>The skull laughed violently from inside her pocket. “They thought you were part of a </span>
      <span class="c12">Misemono</span>
      <span class="c1"> freak show.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>

      <span class="c1">The streets grew quiet. A man in iron and leather armor, laced together with red wool and appeared with a torch in hand. He wore a kabuto with a gold trimmed visor around the helmet. With his other hand he revealed a piece of paper, with the words “Wanted.” in their tongue. </span>

      <span class="c1">“Another skuller has gone missing.” The man spoke. “The regent wishes for them to be found and brought to the castle immediately. Fifty coins will be given for her capture. Alive. Unless she is without the shipment, then he will accept her head. Search the outskirts.” </span>

        The memory of Mibu telling her not to talk came to her mind. She disappeared into a closed unlit shop away from the commotion in the streets. But not before seeing the boy and the girl approach the soldier.

        <br/>
        Saku squatted down behind the wooden counter beneath stacked white ramen bowls with blue trim. The world was silent, and shadows of the people standing too afraid to move fluttered on the transparent rice paper wall.

She found the entrance, and exchanged a palm full of rice for admission.  A man with a large straw hat and face paint accepted the payment and motioned them inside. He watched her, not blinking, as she wandered into the masses of spectators. </span>

        Singing filled the air inside the bright bazaar-like atmosphere. A woman dressed as a samurai danced and sung on stage around vender carts and stalls. Nearby a man held a pair of scissors in the air shouting “Get your haircuts here! Ponytails half-off!”

Grass huts and a main stage crafted from bamboo had signs above them, such as  “Large bird swallows hot coals here!” or “It’s a real camel! 1 coin.” From carts and booths   workers in tattered clothes took down signs and put away items, such as handmade dolls and painted pieces of wood with characters on them. </span>

        “I am Oni-chan.” He said, not hearing the skull. Or not responding to it if he did.  “We are closing as soon as the performance is finished. We open tomorrow morning, it’s half price for you little ones.” He squinted at Saku. He observed for a moment, before looking to her pockets.

        <br/>
        He raised his hands in defense. “Hey now, I’m trying to help you. They are fake. Don’t accuse me of selling those flowers they have by the castle if that is what you are meaning.

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Bring this hideous liar to the castle.” He said, seemingly to others who had entered the room. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku felt a hand on her shoulders. She jumped. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“This way.” The man with the straw hat said.   </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">When Saku left that night, creeping past royal guards who surrounded the Misemono, she left with an Oni-chan doll and a mermaid handbag she had been given on the way out by the man who took her admission. They made their way into the night towards the market district. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That Oni-chan really went all out for you. I wouldn’t get beat up for you.” Kamo said. “And, I thought the act was pretty funny.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku, despite how she felt, didn’t fling the skull into the sky in the middle of the night but did give it a whack on the top of its head with her index finger. The shops had closed for the night and only a few lanterns were lit. Because of this, a vast array of stars hovered above Saku. She stared at them, as she often did when it was clear, and wondered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I thought I would find help here.” Saku said. “There is no help. I’m on my own. And I can not fail. I’m going to find a way to free Oni-chan. I won’t allow anyone else to get hurt because of me.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I mean, I got us here.” Kamo said. “I’d call that helping. Yes, I told you to tell the ducklings who you were so I did mess up. But you had a shouting match that let everyone know where you were, so maybe we should call it even.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku found herself smiling at this. She wiped it off her face as soon as she heard screaming. She looked to see where the noise was coming from.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Isn’t that where we are going?” Kamo asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span>She kept walking toward the screams. Her pace quickened.</span>

      <span class="c10">Episode Three </span>
    </h1>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Guided by distant voices, Saku navigated to the market district, where multi-level housing structures loomed above. Fearful whispers came from people in the windows, as well as the gathered crowd in the square below. Three men in armor stood with a boy and his sister with cloth wrapped around their eyes. She ran faster, feeling the ground uneven on her bare feet. She gripped the hilt of the katana around her waist. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Don’t!” Someone screamed. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You remember you don’t know how to use that sword right?” Kamo said to her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The large men holding the children stood next to a flower cart and a number of booths with high scaffolding. They wore red overvest around their white kimonos, with a katana strapped around their waists. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        At the front of the crowd people lay down their large curved swords. Saku joined in the back and watched as one by one people began to kneel. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “I don’t care who demanded it.” One of them spoke, refusing to lower his weapon. “This is madness! We don’t know where she is!” 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You were warned, and yet there were uprisings.” The man holding the boy hostage spoke. His helmet had a large half crescent symbol on the front. His skin looked weathered, his eyes old, but unwavering.“This is how Lord Yataku deals with these problems now. There is no exception. The skull girl was reported found, yet not taken to the castle. Their fate will be the same as the head of the Misemono. Failure will no longer be tolerated.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Unless one of you brings us the skull girl. And the bag she was carrying.” Another of them said. He tightened his grip on his yari and the frightened girl at the same time. She breathed heavily, and her hands shook. Her brother tried to control his breathing, while he kept turning his head as if to look for his sister through the blindfold. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku’s eyes darted to the little girls whose dress she recognized, the one who wanted a skull flower.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">One by one the market guards lay on the ground and put their hands on their head in a plea of mercy. The crowd slowly began to do the same, dropping to their knees, then laying down. Begging. Voices from the housing above cried down. “Let them go!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“There’s nothing you can do” Kamo said.  “Not with the reach of those long weapons against your stubby little sword. Not three against one. Let’s sneak out of here while you still can…” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Before he could finish speaking, he realized everything had gone silent. Only Saku remained standing. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“If you want my head, then come take it from me.” She said stepping forward. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        <br/>
        “Why don’t you think about anything you are doing! These are pro’s.” Kamo said. “Well. Nice knowing you.”  
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The three men took a step forward, not releasing the children. Saku unshelved the sword as fast as she could and held it up. The blade shook in the air. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What are you doing? You’re holding that in your left hand. You people things always fight with your right…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I use my left hand.” She said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Kamo quacked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        The guard with the girl let her go, his left hand grabbing the far end of the yari. He slashed down at her, his blade meeting hers with a clang. The katana fell to the ground from Saku’s hand. She grasped her wrist and watched as the man used the center of his weapon to knock her to the ground. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Okay, time to get up. You got this.” Kamo tried to sound encouraging.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“She doesn’t have the tea! We can kill her!” A guard said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She leapt onto her feet, and sprung onto a cart before the man could bring the weapon up to strike again. He stopped, looking amazed at her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Get her Hojo!” One of the armored men cried.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Can she do that, Ito?” He yelled, turning to the other two holding onto the kids. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She climbed up to the booth scaffolding, that bent and shook with each step she took. The yari jabbed in front of her, still being in reach from the ground. She brought the sword up again, swinging her elbows back, trying to find her balance. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A voice called out somewhere nearby. “Nope, don’t hold it like that, you're exposing yourself. Hold up the katana with two hands, at an angle low in front of you with the blade pointing up.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She looked round, looking for the source of the voice but stopped when the men started kicking the support beams. The reed of the scaffolding began to shake. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What are you doing? No one does that in a fight, that’s against the code!” The man shouted at her.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The boy squirmed in his capturers hands. The guard dropped his weapon and wrapped his arms tightly around the child. “There’s no code Hojo! Just kill this girl already.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Don’t be over spirited, and don’t let the enemy see your spirit.” The skull said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Come again?” She said nervously, trying to catch her breath.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Chill out and focus on your breathing.” The voice went on. “If they swing, swing downwards to defend then get your sword back up high. But keep it low enough you can cut them if you need to. Watch their movements.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku jumped onto the ground below. The guard saw this, and took a jab at her.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Clank! She swung low to block a cutting sword. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Slash!” The voice cried. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The katana flicked up and slashed the cheek of the man hard. He let out a cry. She staggered, gasping for air before raising her sword to meet his weapons thrust. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Breathe through your nose, exhale out the mouth when you swing.” The voice seemed to be coming out of an eagle-owl skull laying on one of the plates in an outdoor eatery nearby. It sat alone, as if someone had placed it there after a meal had been finished. The other man bobbed his head twice, then swung, heaving out all their air through their nose. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She raised her elbow up to block. She spotted his right knee had extended too far in the movement of the swing. She tried to slash but, out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of the other man holding his Yari high. Having released his grip, the boy ran free. The children took off their blind folds and raced towards the people still on the ground. They stood up and gathered around the kids, making their escape leaving only the guards and Saku in the market. Her hands held the sword at the base position.  She took a chance, and swung. The weapons clanked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Yeah, no don’t do that. Just try to stay alive. You can’t beat these guards.” The voice said. “Let them make the mistakes.“</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Who are you?” Saku yelled, quickly moving behind a bin, dodging an attack.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “I am known by the name Fushichou.” The small eagle-owl skull said. “Don’t lose focus!” 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Then stop talking!” Saku shouted. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        The three guards found themselves on the wrong side of a booth, unable to reach Saku as she ran. She jumped on a stall and reached for the banner to pull herself up. The banner ripped, sending her crashing down. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        They stood in front of her with their weapons drawn. The one called Ito nodded to Hojo, who unleashed a mighty swing down towards her. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">But he stopped.  He stared at something in front of him in the distance. The other's gaze turned to whom he was looking at. A man wearing a bright orange kimono walked into the market with a bow on his back. He walked leisurely towards them.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’d leave the skullie alone.” A familiar voice rang out. “She’s taking it easy on you.” Ayashi walked to the flower cart, and picked a yellow morning glory and placed it behind his left ear. He picked up Fushichou from the table of the eatery. “That’s yours Saku.’ He tossed the skull to her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Nice throw.” Fushichou said. “And soft hands. You must study this well.” Saku put the skull in her pocket. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You have no business here, Ayashi.” The guard said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The man withdrew from the skull person and turned his focus to Ayashi. He readied the bow, drew an arrow pointed at the gaurd. His shadow stretched far out in front of him. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Ayashi pulled the string tighter. “Tell the regent he can’t rule a city if he keeps killing all its people.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We are everyone’s problem right now.” The man called Ito said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A flash from high above caught Saku’s eyes. Without thinking she swung, slashing Hojo’s side, who had tried to take a swipe at her. The man cried out in pain. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Stop!” Ito cried.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Then don’t come at me.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Told you.” Ayashi spoke. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Ito rushed to the side of the fallen man. The cut was deep in his flesh. “My son!” He cried. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        Saku’s face turned white.  Ito’s face turned red. He looked to Ayashi, then to Saku.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Next time skull girl, it will be me talking to your skull.” He said. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Ito and the other guard helped the wounded man up. Blood gushed from his side. His face narrowed when he realized the commoners still watched from the windows above. The three men left the market. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Fushichou was my master's trained bird.” Ayashi said. “And my gift to you for almost cutting you in half. That and the sword you stole from me, you can have that too I guess. ” </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>

        “You’re welcome.” Ayashi said. “I was wrong to trying to kill you. Nothing we can do about it now.” He paused a long while before saying. “When was the last time you ate?” 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Saku’s nostrils flared. “I will do nothing you…”

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        Ayashi rolled his eyes. “You saw the daimyo and his son, whom you have seriously injuried. If you don’t come with me, and listen to what I have to say. Then he will make sure you die.” 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “That was the Daimyo?” She asked.

        Ayashi straightened his garment and hummed softly to himself. Saku narrowed her eyes as he walked away. She went after him.

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Drunk men stood on their chairs, singing together as Ayashi sat down reaching for a grilled meat stick. He took a giant bite as one of the patrons took a step onto the table before the barkeep verbally berated the men for standing on furniture.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’re safe here. I’ve bought you some time. Eat.” Ayashi said to Saku, who sat facing the door on the other side of the izakaya. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You need your strength.” He went on. “What I need your help on next isn’t going to be easy.” </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku looked at him, then down to the meat. “One. I’m not helping you. Two. I don’t eat that.”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Who doesn’t eat meat?” He said.  “This is good, it’s teriyaki. It tastes sweet…Fine. Then tell the bartender what you want. Hey! Ayumi! Can you bar-keep skullie here, some animal feed or something?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What do you want?” Ayumi asked, walking over swinging a rag. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Rice.” She said. “With vegetables, if you have them.”</span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s all you want? You sure you don’t want some Pork?” He pointed to meat sizzling over hot coals. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Yeah, try the chicken.” Something in the wastebasket said. “I bet I taste great! I’m fresh! I didn’t even see it coming! I went to the feeder to see if a butterfly was still hanging around and, then WHACK. That was it for me haha. Oh. I had so much I was planning on doing. I guess I wont get to do any of that anymore. I really wanted to see that butterfly.” The voice inside the basket grew sad. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Ayumi tried to figure out why Saku didn’t speak. “The meat is fresh.” </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku began to cry. “Can you get me rice and vegetables please?”</span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        The man shrugged and returned to the stoves to prepare the meal. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        She noticed two armored men in blue in a booth in the corner of the small room, downing sake as fast as they could. They didn’t look like the guards Saku had seen, and she wondered who they were and why they were there. Though Ayashi did not seem bothered, she watched them from a safe distance. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">After a while, Ayumi came back with a giant bowl of rice, stacked high, along with a plate of roasted vegetables. Saku stuffed rice inside her mouth and shoveled in the vegetables with chopsticks as fast as she could. The soldiers in blue scoffed. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Are we having an eating contest?” Ayashi asked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku talked with her mouth full. “Only reason I’m here is because I haven’t eaten in almost two days. You tried to kill me.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span>
        “I get it.” Ayashi said. “I’m naughty, but I’m going to tell you where your tea is. No strings attached. Which is usually my choice on how to make arrangements.” 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The conversation of soldiers in blue nearby grow in volume. One spoke, too loudly before returning to a whisper. “...Bloody 
      </span>
      <span class="c12">skuller</span>
      <span class="c1">…” The other man nodded and poured back another cup. “... that village is complicating the peace talks.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hearing the slur almost made Saku stop eating. Almost. After she had eaten the last Lotus root and sweet potato, she finished her rice. She poured water into the bowl, swirled it around, and then drank the water, making sure every grain of rice was gone. She placed the chopsticks in the bowl and sat it on the table as the soldiers gave the barkeep a few coins and left. But not before giving Saku a cold hard look. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’re going to see a lot of that sort of talk up north.” Ayashi said. “They are like birds, who repeat everything they hear. They know Nothing. You can’t do about that. What you can do is get the tea. It’s in the red-light district at the kissing house.  Past the street gambling alleys. Someone holding it for you, waiting.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku shook her head in confusion. She raised her hands upwards and spread them apart with her palms facing up. “The kissing house?” Did you leave something in your room when you stayed there?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “Not my kind of place. Most of the tea is intact. I’ve enjoyed a couple of cups but I’m not hearing skulls talk. I left it for someone who needed it.” 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Voices raised. “Maybe the northern clan could show us a thing or two about bringing wealth!”
      </span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “You are a traitor even suggesting such a thing!” The other drunk man shouted. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Ayashi looked over. The arguing stopped, and the men returned quietly to their drinks. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “The tea will be there waiting for you with a geisha. Named Hana.” Ayashi said.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “I don’t have a choice. Do I?” Saku asked. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Sure you do. I paved the entire road ahead of you. You can pick which side you walk on. Don’t forget that.” He said. “You better get out of here. Ayumi is pretty shady. If they don’t already know where you are, then they soon will.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What you say?” Ayumi asked.</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I said you were a great friend.” He said. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I will go. But I do not forgive you.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Good.” Ayashi said. “Forgiveness is a means of control. I’m not here to control you.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        <br/>
        Saku left. Ayumi looked on from the counter, deep in thought. He checked his cash box, and frowned at the  mostly empty wooden container. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The glow got brighter as Saku walked towards the red light district. Men stumbled drunk smelling of sake and sweat. Music could be heard playing down the street at the kissing house. Dice rolled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“It’s gonna be Cho!” A voice cried from inside the cup a man was shaking. The man took bets and slammed the glass upside down on the ground. He lifted to reveal two dice both with one red dot facing up. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Even!” The cup man said. It was Cho.  A few men grunted and groaned. The cup man took the bets and placed them into his earnings. “Don’t complain. Next game. Don’t be cheap.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Kamo spoke from Saku’s pocket. “What was that voice?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They must be made of skulls.” Saku said. Such games were not allowed in her village. She found herself wanting to learn how to play. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        She walked past the gambling and into the red light district. The strong smell of incense and perfumes hoovered in the air. Yet, something smelled fowl. Her eyes adjusted to the red light. She could see the kissing house on the left. A giant structure with a rice paper front with the words “Kuchibashi-ya” written on it. A large cherry blossom was painted on the paper next to the door.  A few men crossed over from a bar across the street into the kissing house, hanging on each other singing loudly. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Kamo let out a nervous sigh. “This is all very bad…”
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Kamo is it?” The other skull said, “Nothing comes easy. You seem to lack direction my friend.”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She tried to clear her mind, and separate her thoughts from those of the skulls. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Oh I LACK DIRECTION!” Kamo lashed out. “You going to tell me how to breathe too?”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’re dead, you don’t do that.” Fushichou said. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“STOP!” Saku yelled, clenching her fist and tightening her face. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The air filled with static. She felt a sting and a few hairs on her head stood up.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’re both great, you’re awesome. But I have way too many thoughts for everyone to be talking all the time.” She said. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        Inside the kissing house men laughed, glasses clanked, and young women in white face paint and long kimonos hung onto the men. Saku did not know whom she was searching for, and knew she couldn’t go in and start asking everyone where Hana was. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        She walked past the entrance, hearing some shaking in a room closed off with a divider painted with a smiley face. Women giggled. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Everyone seemed to be involved with someone else in the room. Except one. She stared at Saku as if she had never seen anything like it. She couldn’t look away. She walked across the tatami mat. Her white painted face and blackened teeth, red stick and eye liner stood out amongst the other women. Her figure was stunning, especially to someone who had not seen a kimono look as smooth and soft. Her eyes locked with Saku’s. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">When she got too close, she took her hands and put them around her face. She spoke, passionately. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“‘I’ve been waiting for you. Tell me you are looking for Hanna. ” The Geisha said. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What?” Saku said, noticing the woman's hands smelled of expensive perfume. “Ayashi says you have my tea. I need it.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“This way.” Hana motioned towards a divided room. They entered, and she slid the door shut.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She spoke. “You must know something. I am lord Yataku’s wife. Vanished here for speaking out about his treatment of the people. If you help me escape from this city, he will not let you live. He will kill you. It’s a matter of time at this point. The only one who can change my husband's mind is Ito. If you help me out of the city, I will convince him to help us.”</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A voice raised in the other room. A scuffle broke out, cups crashed to the floor. Women yelled. Multiple footsteps clopped against the flooring. </span>

    <p class="c0">

        “Ayumi said the skull girl is here,” Someone said. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
         “There’s no way out of here. Please tell me you know how to use that sword.” Hanna said, pointing down.

        “I’ve gotten lucky a few times.” Saku confessed.  
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Where is she?!” Saku remembered the voice of Ito, who stood on the other side of the divider.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The door began to slide open. Saku kicked the rice panel as hard as she could. She grabbed Hana’s hand and pulled her out of the room. Ito turned and ran towards them with a sword in his red swollen hand. 
      </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">

      <span class="c1">“Ito. We need to talk.” Saku pleaded. </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku swung in a wide sweep. Ito dug his foot into the tatami mat and leaned to avoid the hit. But the katana cut him across the side, slicing open his armor. She rushed out of the kissing house and onto the street nearly stumbling into some bystanders who had gathered to watch the commotion. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku saw Ito had crossed over the building's threshold and had closed the distance. The giant man charged at little Saku. In desperation, she hooked his shoulder with her arm and used his momentum to suplex him. The back of his head thumped against the stone road hard. His pupils dilated. He didn’t move, he looked up. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Lord Yutaka will surely kill you now.” Ito said, slurring his words. “Even if you give him his tea. You have shamed him in front of the other warlords. By not arriving on time. He will not stop until you are dead.” </span>

      <span>They heard footsteps and clanking of armor approaching. Saku and Hanna ran. Hanna had the bag of tea in hand. Others went to Ito's side, and began to give aid in whatever way they could. Somebody cried for help. But his own men did nothing. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m in the wrong pocket! I don’t like this, why am I here?!” Kamo said from within Saku’s garment. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku switched Kamo and Fushichou positions in the dark not far from the gambling den. The area was silent after the events earlier in the day. Hanna returned from peering over the wall of the housing complex, keeping an eye out for Ito’s men. She tilted her head and brought her lips forward. A strange sparkly breeze passed through the air. Hairs on Saku’s head stood up. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What have I done Kamo?” Saku said, not noticing anything but her own thoughts. She crossed her arms tightly and gripped her hands. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Actually, I like the other pocket better.” Kamo said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hana smiled like she thought Saku was playing a strange game with her. “Kamo? It’s only us here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku pulled the skull from her pocket. “Here he is. I can hear a soul inside this skull.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hana screamed, then covered her mouth. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’ll admit this isn’t the best I’ve looked, but that was uncalled for.” He said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Saku, We need to get as far away from my husband and the city as possible. He might change his mind after a few days. His mood might blown over.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I know I was late,” Saku said “but I have done nothing to deserve this.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Nothing?” Hanna said, leaning harder against the wall, tugging on her kimono’s sleeves. “You hurt his Daimyo, and his son. And you are aligned with Ayashi. The one Lord Yataku blames for the death of his son. From his wife before me. And you saved me from the kissing house!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku lowered her eyes. “I have nothing to do with Ayashi. I need to fix this.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s not how anyone sees it now. ” Hanna said. “Please listen to me. This goes deeper than you know. I can not let you go to Lord Yutaka. I once pledged my life to serve the Miko. I served as a shrine maiden to a shaman until I came of age. Until my family gave me to him. To settle a dispute. He is quick to take revenge for the most petty things. It’s not only you in danger. It is everyone. The people here, Lord Yataku’s enemy’s… and your village. ”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What dispute?” Saku asked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hana was taken back. “Over land. Your village. The matter was settled. Until my brother did what my brother does. That is why you can not go tonight.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Your brother?” Saku asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hanna wiped her face with the hem of her garment, and patted her skin to remove some of the makeup. Some of the white paint remained on her forehead and cheeks. She felt her skin. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “Ayashi. Is my brother. The son of Lord Noriko of the north.” She spoke, closing her eyes. “He was given to Lord Yataku in the arrangement as a warrior. He was disowned when he killed his son in battle.” 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “I can not fail Mibu.” Saku said. “I’m not leaving without a solution.”
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You won’t be failing your village.” Hanna said. “I promise. Get me somewhere safe for a little while, and then we can return and go to the castle. I can train you to use that sword, and…I can prepare you for this fight.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku looked to the stars.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A loud bell tolled across the city. Hanna gasped. It rang, repeatedly. A long held note blasted from a multitude of horns far away. Windows and doors shut. Slowly the light from the surrounding city ceased until the sky was pitch black. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Is it time to work?” Saku asked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No.” Hanna said. “Lord Yataku has locked the city down. There will be men at all the exits. They aren’t going to let us leave. We can try to find a place to hide in the city until we can find a way out and…” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku again looked to the stars. “My parents were taken from me by the conquerors when I was young, which happens to all children who are allowed to live in my village. But I met my Mom once. We snuck off in the night and watched the stars. She told me she knew her mother, who used to only tell certain stories when certain stars could be seen. That was the only time our people would share the tales. I hated how long they were. But now, I wish I could listen. Because I don’t remember the story she told. No one knows the stories anymore.  Yet my village sings the praises of the conquerors for saving them. Life is a gift that has been taken from us. I don’t want to be silenced anymore. Go wherever is safe Hanna, Get out of the city as soon as you can.” Saku tightened her hair tie. “I wish you the best of luck.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Saku no.” Hanna said. “You can not do this, you are weak, he will make an example of you. You need to come with me and…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Can you send word for him to meet me at the warehouse?” Saku said, heaving the tea bag over her back shoulder. Hanna nodded. “Until we meet again. Or. In the next life if nothing else.” She said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> “And Saku. We still need Lord Yataku. Cause. If my father gains control. You wont have a village to go back to.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku paused before adjusting the bag on her back. She disappeared into the night. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">***</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Three guards came out of the darkness and surrounded Saku, who stood with in the middle of the warehouse. She drew her sword. Her heart pounded. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A deep voice echoed through the large room, surrounded by bins and shelves of goods. She recognized the voice. “I have been told your name is Sakura. Your head isn’t very good is it?  Put the sword down.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">He appeared, catching Saku off guard. He adjusted his hair in his topknot, and motioned for a young woman to approach. She handed him a pipe and incense, which he lit and smoked. He exhaled and handed the object back to a geisha. He tightened the sash on his red kimono. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You should do as he says. For now.” Fushichou advised. Saku lowered the sword but did not put it in its sheath. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What did you think would happen here tonight? Saku?” He said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I plead with you.” She said. “Please do not let my actions affect my village. My fault is my own. I will do whatever it takes to make things right in your eyes.”  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Lord Yutaka crossed his arms. His guards looked at each other. “I’ll let you explain to me, your regent, why you feel you do not deserve death. For allowing me to show our enemies such weakness. Why should your village should go unpunished? The ones who sent such an incompetent little girl. I shall entertain your answer.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Ayashi stole it from me.” Saku said. “I had to track it down. My village did nothing wrong.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They sent you.” He said. “This is the third time the delivery did not arrive. You were unacceptably late. Which is none of my concern. But then I hear, Saku, that my doctor tells me that my Daimyo needs special herbal treatment, because of something you did. A leaf that grows not in this area. I know you not, but you somehow have become a menace that I can not let stand.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What if I find you this leaf?” Saku said. “To make things right? Then I will return to my village, and you will have no dealing with me from here on out.” Saku tightened the grip on her katana. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I need no help from a skull person.” Lord Yataku spoke. A guard offered him a sword, which he took. “I do not accept failure.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Let me do it for you.” The guard said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I can handle a sixteen year old woman.” Lord Yataku said, smacking the guard. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m twenty six.” Saku said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She pulled the sword back to face upright and found her center, standing shoulder length apart. He held the sword high and sideways in the air and rushed at Saku letting out a cry. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">With the flick of Saku's top wrist, she swung up hard, hitting an exposed elbow. Blood gushed. He cried out in pain, and took the sword in his left hand. A guard came to his side, but he used the edge of the hilt to hit the man on the head. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She backed away and dove into one the four long aisles. Yataku crossed after her. Saku had run to the end of the row, looking back to see Lord Yataku tucking his elbow into his ribs. He winced in pain but walked towards her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku quickly took Kamo out of her pocket, stood on her tip toes and placed him on a shelf up high above. From the corner of her eyes she spotted the regent. He swung.  The blade hit Saku’s shoulder and cut her garment and slashing her skin. She sprinted past sake barrels, and ducked down out of sigh. While he searched for her, she placed Fushichou on a pallet stacked with perfume crates. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She reached and grabbed a hold of the top shelf. The bare soles of her feet bounced off the bamboo and she leapt into the air. Before she could gain her footing, Yataku caught her with his other injured arm and yanked her off. She grabbed at his elbow as she fell towards the ground. He let go. Saku cleared out of the row. He stood, bleeding, still searching for her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Fushichou called out. “Don’t go that way, he’s headed in your direction.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Kamo chimed in. “His guards aren’t doing anything, you should be able to run out of here if you can get away. ” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku jumped to a shelf, but the top plank snapped in half. She was able to straddle what remained of the shelf, but Yataku spotted her. Before she could react, he threw his sword at her. She ducked, but could hold her balance no longer, especially with the tea on her back. The fall sent her head first to the ground, with the katana still in her hand. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Her vision blurred. He approached where she lay and picked up his sword. Before he could swing at her, she stood to her feet and slashed at the shelf, sending paper goods and jewelry flying. Her arms reached out and pulled herself through to the other side. Once she had crossed, she turned and backed away facing the cut she had made. She readied her sword. A knee cap came into view. She slashed. She felt her left foot slip on the dirt from the weight of the swing. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">With his left hand Lord Yataku swung down. The swords clanked. Saku’s press the blades towards his face, her blade close to touching his cheek. Trying to muster all her strength she pushed with her right hand on the katana. But in doing so, her feet slipped. She felt the sword leave her fingers. He headbutted her.  She fell. After impact, Saku twisted back around looking up, discovering Lord Yataku above her. Blood dripped from Saku’s face.  She starred. Not blinking. His brow narrowed. He pointed the edge of the blade at her heart. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku’s elbow jerked back. She threw the bag of tea at Lord Yataku and screamed. With every single inch of soul and being. Her throat went raw and it burned as she yelled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Thunder clapped. The air filled with static. A flash binded them as lightning cracked through the thatch roof. The bolt struck Yataku. His body fell to the ground like a rag doll. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku stood to her feet, but her knees buckled. Her mouth dropped. She put her weight on the bamboo shelf. Her head felt dizzy. Her body was faint. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A voice cried from the other side of the warehouse. “I told you that you could shoot lightning from the sky! But noooo. Don’t believe Kamo.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Is he alright!” Asked Fushichou. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Lord Yataku lay with half his face in the dirt. His hair sprawled out in chunks on the ground. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku shook her head. “I… don’t think so.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">His guards closed in. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Help!” She called to them. “What did I do? Someone help him!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The guard did nothing. Another approached and looked down to his leader. They crossed their arms almost at the same time. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku grabbed Fushichou from the shelf and ran to the other end to collect Kamo. She put the skulls into her pocket and exited the warehouse. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Once outside Saku panicked, finding a corner and making herself small. She saw someone running in the darkness towards her. She backed further into the small space. Lights in the city began to be lit. Soon she could see Oni-chan in front of her, with his hands and feet bound in rope. She went to him, cut the ropes, and shelved the sword. She cried standing in front of him, swollen. Broken.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What. Happened?” He asked. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">–</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“The guards heard something, then gave up and let me go.” Oni-chan said. Water boiled in a pot on top of a lit fire in the hut. The sound of chaos could be heard outside, with the misemono performers and the rest of the city learning the news about the daimyo’s and the regent's death.</span>
    </p>

      <span class="c1">“I ran from the castle as fast as I could.” Oni-chan went on.  “Do you mean.” Oni-chan said, “That you have taken down both Lord Yataku and the daimyo in the same evening?” He walked to the pot and wet the cloth in the hot water. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Yes.” Saku said. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hana gasped. “Once my father hears of this. He will try to take control of Shao Song.”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“There is no town guard left either.”  Oni-chan said. “There is no one to protect the city other than his forces, most of whom are off aiding the northwest. “ </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku refused Oni-chan’s help. “The guards did not come to Lord Yataku’s side when the lightning struck him. They stood there, willing to watch a living man die.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Wait.” Oni-chan said. “He got hit by lightning?” </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Now you got to master talking to animals and you're set!” Kamo said to her. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku sighed. “I think the tea has given me these powers.” </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Are you sure you don’t want an exhibit in this misemono?” Oni-chan said. “Once you have overthrown the city. And taken control before the forces of the north do? No one will remember Oniku!”</span>

        “You can’t be serious.” Hanna spoke. She hid her arms in her Kimono and rocked on the back of her feet. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Saku stood and paced the floor. Her legs were weak and stiff, but she managed to walk to the other side of the room. She reached inside the large wooden barrel filling a pitcher. She drank from it with both hands, gulping. She slammed it on the table. 
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span>
        Her gaze turned to the crackling fire. She held a solution to fix everything.

        “I could be daimyo.” Saku said. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Hanna patted her bare skin with Oni-chans cloth. She looked different without her makeup, more sophisticated than expected. Her kimono shifted on her shoulders as she tugged at the collar. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “You would need control of the workers,” She said. “and the armed forces. We don’t have that. The Tamina clan of the north are cruel and will destroy your village the first chance they get. Lord Niroko is not merciful like Lord Yataku was.” 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Really, she can’t be any worse than the last guy.” Oni-chan said.

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku slowly paced back and forth in the hut. She felt herself checking her pockets, making sure the skulls were still in their place. “But I’m the idiot. I can’t make right decisions, how am I going to know what’s best for that many people? And, this is our chance to rule ourselves. For the first time in a hundred years. ” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hanna shook her head. “This is only going to make matters worse. Yes, I could help you and yes the people respect me. The ones who don’t want me crucified think I’m okay anyways.” She muttered. Her elbows dug into the bamboo table as she put her hands on her chin hard. She sighed deeply with a pained expression on her face. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“When Lord Niroko finds what we are doing,” She went on “know our heads will be removed, cleaned up and dressed up for everyone to see. So if we do this, make sure you look your best.”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I do not want to become someone’s talking head!” Saku shouted.</span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Sparks appeared in the air. As soon as she raised her voice, everyone in the room jumped back. She stopped and looked to the sky, spreading her arms out wide as if she could do something if thunder crashed down. Nothing happened. She repeated herself. Calmly. Everyone returned to where they were standing before. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You were serious.” Oni-chan said. “In that case, I am with you. My head would look good on a display.</span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hanna closed her eyes.  “Tenma was a regular at the kissing house. Yataku’s samurai shall listen to him. We will need his help to rally the left over forces to take the castle. To show the people some legitimacy of your clan. Your divine powers should help.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Oni-chan clapped his hands together excitedly. “You could be Emperor! I think we have one… Bukofu or something? But who cares! You can claim divine right!”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Good thought, but let’s keep it simple.” Hanna said. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku waved Oni-chan off and walked around the water barrel. “I can’t even be in charge of my finances. I got sad once and ate an entire week's wages. Get Ayashi. How can we call on him? The city can rally around him!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“If Lord Yataku is dead, then he is gone.” Hanna said. “ My father is angry at him. He likes his head attached, he tells me often. If you, and your gift do not help us no one will. And they come for the village next.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You mean he would leave us? After cursing me?” Saku said.</span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s pretty typical.” Hanna said. “You. Are the only one who can help us.” </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I did not have “take over Shao Song” in my spirit reading this week.” Oni-chan stated. “I shall spread the word, and I will gather everyone and bring them to the front gate of the castle.”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hanna reached out her hand to Saku’s. “If not you, then who?” </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Kamo coughed from inside the pocket. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“How can you cough if you don’t breathe air?” Saku asked. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Being as out touch as you are with your past and culture and knowing nothing about yourself and all that, is this a good idea?” Kamo asked. “WIth great power comes the ability to roast people like a rice cracker. This could get a lot of people hurt if you don’t use it right.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Fushichou agreed. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku bit her lip, trying to numb the sensation of dread. She took Kamo from his pocket and spoke to him.  “It feels like a lot of  people are going to be hurt no matter what we do.” Saku said. “I told Mibu I would not let her down. I won't back out of that now.” She said. Hanna and Oni-chan looked at each other, uneasy while she spoke to the object in her palm. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I do not agree with this plan.” Kamo said.</span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku placed Kamo back in the pocket, and turned to the two. She nodded firmly. “Let’s find Tenma.”</span>

        The two story wooden structure had the smoothest walls Saku had ever seen. Its pointed roof was tightly woven with thatch, its wood unblemished. The camellia flowers were so brightly yellow that they could be seen in dimly lit city lights. She marvolved at the artisanal compound. The scent of rain clouds rushed past them in a chilling breeze. Saku held up a lantern, with an Oni-chan face painted on it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Only one family lives here?” Saku asked as they waited at the sliding door. “How can they afford it? Do they work a lot of extra shifts at the fields or whatever they do?”
      </span>

      <span class="c1">“Nobles don’t have to worry about money.” Fushichou said. “They don’t have to work for anything.”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The idea of not working was hard for the villager to wrap her head around, having been used to strict routines of labor. A memory came to her mind of receiving her monthly rice rations that had been halved. She had worried how she was going to survive without food. Did these men not worry like that? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A servant came to the door to answer for Tenma, wearing a light red garment with a long sash around the front. They were led to the second level to a room with a giant open window, letting in the night air. A garden filled with Azalea flower beds and tall potted fruiting trees thrived inside the room. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A man entered the garden from the other side. Light shone off the top of his shaved head, his back hair unruly in an up knot. He adjusted his clothing, trying to hide the scar on his neck from them. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“My condolences, Lady Yataku. I received word that he has passed on.” Tenma put a hand on her shoulder. “I understand things were difficult between you and Yataku.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s one way to put it.” Hanna removed Tenma’s hand from her shoulder. Saku could see a tear roll off the corner of her eye.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We need your support.” Saku said. “With Hanna’s help, I am going to rule the city. So I get this is sudden, and you don’t know me. But if you believe…” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Oh, spare me your attempt at politics.” Tenma said, waving his hand into the air dismissively. “If it is for my lady, then you have my support. I do not care that you are a slave. It is time for that way of life to end. Lord Noriko will aim to capture the castle as fast as he can. We must gather everyone and…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">An arrow whistled through the air. Tenma grabbed at the shaft that lodged itself into his chest. He tried to breathe. Hanna and Saku took cover behind the pots as another arrow struck him. His body fell to the ground, on top of a bed of flowers. Peering over her cover, Saku spotted a darkly clothed man standing by the window welding a longbow with gold engravings. The man’s eyes widened. He pulled the string back and aimed in Saku’s direction. The tip cut through the air sharply. Saku spun to the other side of the pot. It struck the fabric on her back, ripped it and cut her skin. Saku screamed with all her might facing towards the attacker from behind cover. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Thunder cracked. She turned to shield her eyes from the flash. Hanna tried to do the same, but could not. Her brown eyes met with the thunderbolt in front of her that ripped through the complex and struck near where the attacker stood. He dropped, and cried out face first into the floor. He laid on his side and curled into a ball, grabbing at the burn marks at his side. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku approached him. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That is your power?” Hanna asked Saku, not moving. “You did that?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Who are you?” Saku asked the man lying on the ground, not noticing Hanna hunched over with her eyes closed tight. His feet were kicking, randomly as if he could not control them. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“When the Skullers are destroyed.” The attacker gritted his teeth as he spoke. “The Tamina will control all the tea. My family gets to live. That make’s both our deaths worth it.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        Dark smoke filled the room. Sparks had ignited the wood of the flower beds, sending flames reaching towards the Tenma clan banner. Hanna tried to walk over to Saku as the fire grew, but she stumbled. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “You work for my Father. You Shinobi. ” She said to the attacker. The man let out a final breath. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Tears from Hanna’s red eyes streamed down her cheeks. Her pupils had turned mostly cloudy white. Saku say them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What did I do?” Saku gasped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Everything is cloudy. Help me out of here. Fast. Where there is one Shinobi, they are others nearby.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku helped Hanna leave the building, hearing frantic voices from within the compound. The air grew cold, colder than any night before it. A breeze swept through the city, causing the clouds of smoke to drift. She felt her hands tremble again. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c12">Can I use this power without hurting someone? </span>
      <span class="c1">She thought. </span>

        When they had left and were sure they hadn’t been followed, they ducked behind a yakitori-ya restaurant. Saku could still smell the grilled meat. She wrinkled her nose in disgust.

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Tenma was our only hope.” Hanna said. She held a hand to her forehead. Her eyes did not move. “We have no way to gain our forces' trust.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Kamo laughed. “I told you running into things without plans doesn’t work.” </span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Shut up Kamo.” Saku said. “Is there anyone in Lord Yataku’s samurai unit that would help us?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Jiro and Bokoni are the only ones. But Bokoni used to serve Noriko before the land was given to the Zumono clan. Though Jiro could lead the remaining men, He was loyal to Yataku, and therefore I am not his best friend so to speak.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A bowl from inside the empty restaurant fell on the ground, letting out a loud CLANK. Saku jumped and drew her katana. A cat with it’s back arched slowly backed away the bowl. She sighed and returned the sword to its place. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’ve gotten yourself in deep in this one.” Kamo said from inside her pocket. “I hope Hanna’s blindness is temporary. ‘Cause that would suck.”</span>

      <span class="c1"/>

      <span class="c1">Hanna reached out, feeling her. When she found her, she drew closer to Saku.  </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“He is our only choice.” Saku said. “We head to the outpost.”</span>

        <br/>
        “Hanna. You can not ask this of me.”  A man with long gray hair spoke, rather harshly. His age could be seen in the wrinkles of his face, and his arm struggled to hold the weapon he was cleaning steady. His nostrils flared from the smell of fire from the cooking pits still burning.   
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m not doing this for me.” Saku said.  “I’m doing this for everyone in Shao Song.” </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">He wiped the blade of his Yari and turned to the remaining tents in the outpost. Where there once had been stationed a thousand men were now only two hundred. The samurai who left when word arrived the regent had been killed and brought none of their belongings along as they fled into the night. Jiro searched another abandoned tent, gathering any weapon he could find. Saku led Hanna as he walked.  </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Why should I trust a tea slave?” He knelt, feeling the cold metal of a sword left in the dirt. He  wiped it with a cloth and took it with him. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We… aren’t slaves.”Saku said. “We are in debt to you conquerors who stopped us from drinking the tea …” She stopped speaking. She swallowed hard and paced back and forth, left to right in front of the man.  “We are slaves, aren’t we?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hanna took a step toward.s Jiro who closed the flap on a tent and wandered to another. “Our choices are to fall to the north, or take the city. All we need to do is go get it.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Is that all?” Jiro sneered. “Walk straight in? Should we knock first? You tell me how this works Hanna. These men are hungry, and their morale is low. If you wanted to help, you would start picking up weapons so we can sell them and buy those who survived the northern siege of Chinoki.”</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’ve stopped a man’s heart tonight. And caught a house on fire” Saku said. “With your leadership, we can do anything if we work together.” </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You? You are the one who killed Lord Yataku?” Jiro blew out his cheeks before throwing a pile of weapons at his own tent. </span>

        “Traitor!” One of the samurai shouted from nearby.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        She addressed the crowd of warriors who gathered. The men looked tired, and thin. “This was not my plan. I do not wish to take life. I want to do what’s best for everyone, but I can’t do it myself.” 
      </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">From behind a rack filled with stored weapons near the tent, Jiro pulled a wooden training sickle. He showed the weapon to Saku and nodded. She shrugged, confused. He tossed it at her. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>

      <span class="c1"/>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No one is cutting grass.” Jiro said. “You are no warrior. I can not fight with you.” </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Why are we fighting with farm equipment? Mibu always beats me when I spar with her like this. What does this prove?” </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We don’t have time for this,” Hanna said. “The north might already be in the castle, we need everyone to go with us. I know a secret path that only a few know. We might be able to force our way in.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku and Jiro turned to one another, realizing she could see less than they thought. Hanna held out her hands in front of her while her white pupils struggled to see the shadows in front of it. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I know what you’re thinking, but I can see a little. I can lead you in the right direction. If we make it in time, we can recruit those remaining in the castle to our cause.” </span>

        Saku pulled Kamo out, as if he were a worry stone.  “Are you with us?” She asked Jiro. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Well of course I am. I’m starting to feel at home in that pocket.”

      <span class="c1">He stared hard at the woman before turning to the dimly lit castle on top of the forested hill. Tall grass near them waved back and forth in the cool breeze. </span>

    <p class="c0">

      <span class="c1">A man rushed into the training grounds, frantic and calling out. “The Tamina clan of the north have sent their forces to the market district! And the Henashi clan of the Northwest have taken the bridge by the Misemono! Jiro you need to do something!”</span>

        <br/>
        Saku removed brown tree needles from her between her toes. The dense conifer trees and steep rocky terrain made traveling difficult for the Tomodachi forces. They made their way slowly upward. The climb felt much longer than it looked. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“If we are where I think we are.” Hanna said. “The gate to the back tunnel path should be up ahead. Someone should make sure it’s clear before we proceed.” A few men in blood soaked clothing and patch work armor left the group to scout up ahead. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">After several minutes they returned. “There’s no one in the garden.” One told Hanna. “They must all have gone to the main castle.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Garden?!” Hanna exclaimed. “We need to go east. I have led us astray.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What garden?” Saku said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“It is of no importance.” She said, “Let’s press on.”</span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        Hanna stood and gently reached for Saku’s hand. She motioned with her head for her to follow. After they walked along a path, they found by lantern light a gate built of stacked stones that created an arch. Beyond it, in the distance, stood the white castle.
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Keep going.” Hanna told the men, struggling to transport the weapons attached to their backs through the thick of the forest. She also took hold of one of the men’s shoulders with her other hand. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Something in her voice gave Saku pause. Ignoring her grip, she pointed the light at an entrance to a stoned off area. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Is this the garden?” Saku asked, walking inside. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hanna tried to pull her along, but she left and entered. “Wait!” Hanna yelled. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Inside Saku found herself in a field of tall flowers. The plant's stalks were tall and husky, and the middle of the red blossom was a white hard seed, shaped like a skull. Red mushrooms grew at the base of the plant, surrounded by animal bones. Saku reached out, standing on her tippy toes, to gently feel the plant she had only heard before. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“These. Were my peoples flowers? The source of the crazy tea?” Saku asked, as a man guided Hanna inside. She remembered the conquerors checking their belongings when she was growing up, looking for seeds even one hundred years later after the take over. Saku had always assumed they were doing this out of the kindness of their heart so that their people could function away from the insanity their way of life brought. Holding the flower in her hands she realized nothing about the way she lived was done out of concern. It was to silence their power. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They're so beautiful.” Saku was able to say.  Her mouth hung open. “This is what made the tea that I carried from Fukui.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span>“No.” Hanna said. “That is tea from another flower. Purchased from the </span>
      <span>Misemono</span>
      <span class="c1">
        . No one is the wiser. Yataku wanted to keep the flower away the village. Now I can see why.” 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        She saw tears in Saku’s eyes. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I have only dreamed of seeing these.” She pulled one down towards her and felt its soft petals on her face. She went on, releasing the flower, and suddenly grasping her necklace. “My mother said she saw one once. On the only night I got to see her. Before they took her away. She refused to tell me where she saw them, in case I went looking for them. But I never have left the village. Why are they growing these still?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        Hanna looked down. “To warn what the Zumono clan would do if they were ever crossed. For a long time. It worked. Come on, I still need your eyes.” Hanna said.  
        <br/>
        <br/>
        “Why did you try to keep me from these?”

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She did not answer her question. She simply said: “The castle isn’t far. We need to move.” </span>

    <p class="c0">

        <br/>
        <br/>
        Once they had passed the fields, they headed east until they found the tunnel. They climbed through the rocky hand dug path up to a raised stone piled platform that stretched the entire length of the foothill. Beyond tree’s above stood the painted white castle, with its four levels with slanted roofs, painted very dark blue. Dim light shown through a multitude of silt windows on the lower half. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“How are we supposed to get in from down here? I thought you knew a way to get in.” A samurai asked.</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I told you I knew a way to the castle, No one said anything about getting in.” Hanna spoke. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku approached the platform and took hold of one of its stones, testing its sturdiness. “This is no bigger than a black pine. I can get in and find out what’s going on.” She found a foothold and began to climb. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Are you insane! You’re going to fall to your death! I’m not ready to die again!” Kamo said.</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I climb these all the time.” She said. Her right hand slipped as she tried to pull herself up, which caused her to lean back. Quickly she found a hold and steadied herself. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“All the time?” Fushichou asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Every once in a while.” Saku admitted.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Slowly, carefully moving up and sideways, she found a secure hold on the boulders and cracks of the platform until she came to a narrow window. She leaned in, palming her left hand, to peek inside. A candle burned from the other side of the small room, filled with bundles of arrows that hung from the wall from leather straps. She struck the wooden bar on the window as hard as she could, but it did not move. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Using the windows ledge as a foot hold, she leveraged herself up. With her other leg she kicked at the bar, making a loud thump.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s a lot of noise you are making.” Kamo said. “You’re going to alert…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Before Kamo could finish speaking Saku had found a hold and lifted herself up, using all her strength so that her feet dangled below her. Using both legs, she kicked cause the wood to crack, sending pieces crashing down to the stone floor. Her fingers slipped, and she felt herself falling. She desperately reached for something to hold. Somehow before falling helplessly below, her fingers caught the edge of the ledge. She dangled for a moment, panting, her face flush. Frantically, she fought to pull herself up and over the window into the room. After positioning herself sitting below the window, she tried to regain her breath. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Well. They know you are here.” Kamo said. Saku drew her katana and stood to her feet. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The halls were quiet. The rooms, decorated with armor displays and pottery, were lit but empty. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Where is everyone?” Saku whispered. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You should open the front and get everyone inside.” Kamo said. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Suddenly a voice rang out in the halls.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You really don’t have to tug on my ear. OUCH! THAT HURTS!” It said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That sounds like Ayashi?” Saku said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Get moving.” Another voice cried. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku turned in time to see Ayashi thrown hard to the tatami mat in a large room next door. She looked up to see someone standing in the shadow of a wood sculpture of a Warrior. The figure held a long bow with an arrow drawn, pointing at Ayashi. She walked into the room and stood at a safe distance away in the shadow of the Zumono family banner. Ayashi looked hurt. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She clenched her fist and gritted her teeth, her eyes pointed in the direction of his capturer. Sparks flew. But then she thought of Hanna. Out there. Blind and helpless. And the building had caught fireearlier. As much as she wanted to, seeing the figure in the shadow, she did use her power. She loosened her grip and calmed herself. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Where is Saku?” The voice cried after a moment of silence. “Or the Ronin dies.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The figure stepped into the light. Saku’s hands shook. “MIBU!” she cried. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“SAKU!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku ran to Mibu and jumped on her, wrapping her legs and arms around her. They hugged each other tightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I thought you had been killed! I left to look for you when you didn’t return. I tracked you to the camp, the Misemono. I heard you were wanted then, everything in the outside world went crazy. It is chaos out there.” Mibu cried.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I almost killed you.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Ayashi remained on the ground. “I’m not the bad guy here, I’m on your side.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I told you, not to speak unless I tell you to!” Mibu said, turning in his direction. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“She jumped me. And took me captive. From behind! That woman is crazy!” He said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Silence!” Mibu yelled. “We’ve been here for hours, where is everyone? What is going on? What’s that in your pocket?” Mibu began to reach into Saku’s pocket.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“NO!” Saku said. But Mibu took the object out anyway. Saku tried to reach to take it back, but Mibu held her hand away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Oh it’s you!” Kamo said, now in Mibu’s hand. “I remember you. You were in the market district one day. You fed some of your onigiri when I was alive.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu looked at the duck skull in horror. She dropped the skull. Saku fell to her knees to save Kamo from falling to the ground. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What is this, Saku? Why do you have this? Like you’re a tea drinker?” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“His name is Kamo. A spirit speaks from within this skull. That of a duck who lived in this area. A duck you shared your Onigiri with when you were in the market district.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu stared at her friend in disbelief. “I told you that story.” She said. “What madness are you speaking?”  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You have to trust me. There are some things I have learned about myself that are going to be very hard to believe.” Saku pulled a skull flower from her bag and presented it to Mibu. “There are a lot of things we were told that are wrong.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Put that away.” Mibu said, turning around in shame. “Why do you have that? You would anger the conquerors with that behavior! We are not to…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Do not speak their names like that.” Saku said. “They were not our friends, as they are now. There is nothing wrong with me. For once everything is right and I have found a way to fix everything.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What did you do? Why are you talking like this? ” Mibu spoke. Her eyes were closed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I forced her to drink the tea.” Ayashi said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No one else has to know.” Mibu said, reaching for Saku’s hand. “We can heal you Saku. Let’s get you home.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No. We are here to take over this city.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu looked at Saku hard, putting her hand to her side. “This isn’t like you.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“But it is.” She said. “This is the real me. I didn’t know. We were lied to. We are freeing the village.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Free? We aren’t slaves we are free. We have a conqueror ruler, what are you talking about? We have two hours a day to do whatever we want!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We are not. I accidentally killed Yataku and messed up his military advisor's head. We decided the town should belong to the people.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu dashed swiftly to Saku and got in her face. “Not only did you drink the forbidden tea, but you are now crazy enough to think you can create a political coup?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Pounding echoed through the walls. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s coming from the front gate.” Mibu said, “quick get the prisoner…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku turned to where Ayashi had been. He had vanished. Mibu narrowed her brow. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I am a fool. Let’s get out of here.” Mibu reached for Saku’s hand.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The two found an opening that looked out to the large arch that led from the forest road to the castle. A multitude of people stood, holding torches shouting. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What are they saying?” Mibu said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">As they listened and watched from the room above, they began to recognize the words the crowd was chatting. Oni-chan and others from the Misemono stood along with them. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Long live Tomodachi.” They cried. Saku squinted, and recognized the girl and his brother standing next to Jiro, who stood tall holding his weapon high. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Why are they saying this?” Mibu asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku’s mouth twisted as she rubbed her fingers together, as if to check if she were awake. “I. Am your daimyo now.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You are delusional.” Mibu said. But Saku stepped out so that the crowd could see her below. Cheers erupted from the people. She saw Hanna and the other forces make their way to join the crowd. Mibu’s jaw dropped and Saku raised her hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“As first order as your daimyo.” She shouted to them. “Fukui and all slaves are free.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu, though baffled, shrugged. “Well. Okay then. You might be crazy. But I’m not going to complain.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Hail Emperor Tomodachi!” A voice cried out. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m not crazy. I can shoot lightning from the sky. But I can’t show you. I can’t hurt you like I've hurt others.” The realization came over her face as she spoke. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Sure you can shoot lightning from your eyes.” Mibu said, softly patting her on the shoulder. As if her friend had too much sake to drink on a day off from the fields.”Have you eaten since you became a tea drinker? Maybe the grain from the rice will soak up the wacky juice in your  stomach.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Strange music began to play from below the forest path. Dark toned flutes rang out. Everyone stepped back, to allow a small band of men coming on the path towards the castle. A single man stood in front of them, holding a message and a torch. Saku and Mibu left, and ran through the castle to the gate below to join the others. They walked to the group. Jiro and his warriors surrounded Saku. A man held out a red wax seal with the northern clan symbol stamped on it. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Lord. Tomodachi. And Lady Hanna.” The man said. “Lord Noriko wishes to speak to you, at a neutral site. The letter also describes the wishes of some samurai who were protecting Lord Yataku. They wish to join our clan.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Jiro looked at Hanna, who frowned. “What is this?” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The man approached Hana. Jiro began to draw his weapon, but Saku motioned for him to halt. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“This is to find a peaceful agreement on your cities surrender. We have made a treaty with the Northwestern clan. The region was given to us in this agreement. We wish for a peaceful transition of power.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Oni-chan took hold of a large club, with pieces of metal sticking through. Others in the crowd did the same. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“The emperor will approve.” He said. “There is no use in resisting. Shao Song belongs to the Tamina clan.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“It belongs to us.” Saku said. Approaching. “The city is of its people. Not Lord Noriko.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The man looked at Saku for a moment. But turned back to Hanna. “We await your reply and cooperation. As do the rest of Yataku’s men who left the castle and joined us.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hana’s eyes met Saku’s. The woman seemed as if she had been in that moment before. She spoke, still looking at Saku. “I shall meet Lord Noriko as he wishes. But we shall not give up this city.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Lord Noriko will look forward to your presence.” The man said. They left. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu lowered her head. “There is no chance the army of this city can match the north if some of their forces have surrounded them. We have no chance.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Kamo and Fushichou have gotten me this far. They will help us.” Saku pulled both skulls out from her pockets. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We are not gods Saku.” Fushichou spoke. “We are just spirits.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Put it away.” Mibu said, dismissively. Mibu hung her head and walked back towards the castle. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hanna was led to Saku. She crossed her arms. “Jiro said you saved his grandkids. He knew not of this before.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She paused. “You know. If both of you had the power of the tea, there’s no way anyone could stop us.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“She doesn’t believe me.” Saku said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hanna’s eyes looked out deep into the night. “I have failed you. If I could have led you here quicker I might have been able to talk the remaining men into staying and fighting with us. You must find a way to show her. Tomorrow, I will find a way to end this.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku looked in despair at Hanna. “You can’t see because of something I did. I can’t risk hurting her. And she is never going to believe me. We need to get away from this castle. I don’t know who thought this was a good idea, but if we are attacked by two armies we would be trapped here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hanna grinned. “Well. Look at you making smart decisions.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span>“Let’s make sure everyone gets something to eat first.” Saku said.  </span>

    </h1>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">For hours Jiro’s men battled to retake the Misemono. The north and their allies retreated to the outskirts of town. At the suggestion of “Lord Tomadachi”, the warriors were sent out to key points in the city until the morning. Fushichou suggested the carnival as a resting place due to its tactical advantage. Saku wasn’t sure what this meant, but it seemed like a good plan. It was her idea for the willing samurai and entertainers to patrol the streets. Until the armies could be repelled. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Outside is a strange choice to sleep,” Oni-chan said. “Are you sure you don’t want a better dwelling? You are the daimyo now.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Oni-chan the lantern, with his own face on it, high so that Mibu could finish placing her bedroll. The giant had placed them in a tent not far from the stage. He realized Saku was looking at the animal hide of the tent, with a look of disgust. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“It is only for the night.” Oni-chan told Saku. “Few hours.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Did it have to be animal?” Saku asked. Oni-chan shrugged. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Really?” Mibu scuffed. “If you wanted you could order twenty geisha’s and a persimmon, and you’re upset that the tent is normal? “We’ve slept in an animal tent before. You didn’t care then.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">They tried to situate themselves in the space as best they could, but the overwhelming feeling of responsibility lingered in Saku’s mind. Giving out orders had been more exchusing than summoning lighting, and the looks from Mibu’s face while doing it tired her more. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Things are different now.” Saku said, still looking at the hide disapprovingly. “Now that I know this was an animal with a story to tell, I can’t look at it the same way anymore. But the tent will do for now.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No more skull talk.” Mibu said. “You will sleep it off.  The city might be fooled, but I’m not. And when they realize it we might be in trouble when the conquerors figure out...”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“They are not our conquerors anymore.” Saku walked to Mibu and gave Oni-chan a look. He got the idea. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We wake early to meet the north at the temple on the edge of the city. Rest well.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Oni-chan nodded at Mibu and returned to his dwelling for the evening. The air had warmed once again and the cicadas chirped. Saku looked down, with her fists clenched as Mibu rummaged through her pack for rations. She found onigiri and handed it to Saku, who took a bite as soon as she could. The salty plum and rice was satisfying, after losing so much strength throughout the past days. Mibu pivoted towards her, and bit into her own ration. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“This is not of craziness.” Saku said after taking a last bite. “This is a gift. A gift we have been lied to about all of our lives.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What are you suggesting? “ Mibu said. “That we were once a village of. What? Tea drinkers? Who really could talk to skulls? And what, the Shao Song took this from us? But let us keep growing the tea for some reason? And no one has bothered to try it, until you Saku? Why would any rational nation do this? I know you can be stupid, but…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I am not stupid. They wanted to suppress our power.” Saku said. “Have you ever thought about our schooling growing up? It's like they wanted to confuse us, and punish us if we did not listen without resistance. So that we follow their rules without question. They take us away from our parents early on to stomp out the last embers of our past. We  are a threat to them. But no more.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Hearing that, Mibu laid on her bed roll. Her hands rested behind her head as she looked up. She closed her eyes and sighed deeply. “I can’t begin to explain how disappointed I am in you. We had a lot of good teachers who worked really hard with us. I never thought you would do this. What you speak is not truth, it is sickness and it is despicable.” Mibu reached under her bedroll and picked up a small rock. She flung the rock into the night. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Why don’t you believe me? You’ve always believed me.” Saku said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu rolled to her side. “This isn’t believable. That is why. We must rest.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“LISTEN TO…” She stopped and covered her mouth with her hands. Mibu jolted up in panic and looked to her. She stood there. Silent for a moment. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I can’t get mad. I want to show you. But I don’t want to hurt you.” Saku said. She sat down next to her on the bedroll. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Why is your hair standing up like that?” Mibu asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“It is because of my powers.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Powers? Really Saku? Thinking you can talk to things is a power?” Mibu rolled back over to face the wall of the tent. “Bet you haven’t washed it since you set off for the trip. That’s why.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku turned to the bag she had been given with the skull flowers inside. She wanted to look at them, but did not want to start a fight. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Saku.” Kamo said. “I’m not sure what to do about your friend there, but if you put me somewhere I can see I can scream at you until you wake up. That way you get up early.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Really?” Saku whispered. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What?” Mibu said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Nothing.” She took Kamo out of her pocket and placed him so that he could see outside. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu rolled over to see what Saku was doing. She frowned. “Can we put the gross toys away please?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Kamo is my friend.” Saku said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I am too tired.” Mibu said. “Come back to me. The real you. The one who understands the value of hard work and loyalty. If you continue on like this, I won’t be helping you. Our village will not either. Daimyo, or not.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku said nothing. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Now hold my hand.” Mibu said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She did. Her eyes did not close for a long while. She wondered to herself how she could prove her truth. But her eyes grew heavy, and soon she drifted into sleep.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">–</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“WAKE UP!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku rose at the sound of the screaming skull. A sharp blistering thump rang out. At first Saku thought it was the wind, but realized an arrow had struck the tent tool. It’s shaft was painted blue. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Mibu!” Saku shook her friend and looked back out.  Mibu sat up. She grabbed the bag and her weapons.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I heard commotion in the distance.” Kamo said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu grabbed the long bow and searched the area. On the edge of the misemono lights flicker. The sky gently began to light with dark blue light. The morning sun would soon make an appearance. They could hear the cries of men and swords clashing. She reached for an arrow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She took a step forward and signaled Saku to be silent as she choked down her emotions.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“She’s listening to screaming.” Fushichou said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We must go help them.” Saku said, beginning to walk in that direction.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“If that is the clans, we can not fight them by ourselves. Even if you think you have powers, there’s too many of them. We need to get out of here.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We can’t leave Oni-chan.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“There’s nothing we can…” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku ran towards the sound of the clanking. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“ Stop!” Mibu cried to her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She didn’t listen. She hurried towards the misemono entrance, holding her katana high. Mibu ran after her with her weapon drawn. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Oni-chan and other performers struggled to keep a large bamboo gate closed. Others and their families scattered into a chaotic collecting of belongings. Cries rang out from the other side. Saku put the sword back in it’s sheath, and ran to help. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Wait.” Oni-chan shouted. “You need to get out of here. Noriko is going to want you dead.” His massive forearms strained against the efforts of the outsider invaders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I won't leave you. We aren’t finished here. We need you...” Saku said, stepping up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Dozens of sharp twangs ripped out from above. Arrows flew over the wall. Saku turned and saw Mibu leap in the field behind her, missing an arrow narrowly. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Get out of here. ” He said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu cried out. “We need to tell others before the entire city falls. We can get the word out at the castle.” Mibu said, readying her bow looking at the gate. Saku’s eyes drew to where the cracking sound was coming from. With a snap, the gate broke in two.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “Thank you for your kindness.” Saku said. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Saku met Mibu and dashed towards the back of the fenced property. A wave of men lunged across of what remained of the gate. Entertainers, a “yokai” and a ‘kappa’, or so they claimed to be, fought with crude stage weapons against the north's strongly crafted katana’s. 
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Oni-chan dug in his heels but could hold the men back no farther. Dirt spread upward from where he landed. A balding man in a blue kimono with his hair pulled back stood over him. The Tomodachi samurai fought back around Oni-chan, trying to get to his position. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Oni-chan tried to get to his feet, but it was too late. Saku could only watch from afar as the northern samurai jabbed the dagger into him. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">***</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The two women found themselves running through smokey streets heading towards the castle. Saku breathed in sharp through her nose, and smelt a bitter and grassy burn. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“The flowers!” Saku shouted to Mibu. She pointed towards the smoke. She quickened her pace towards the skull flower fields. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Can you stop running into danger!” Mibu  passed the stone entrance and joined Saku in the fields, who was cutting every flower she could. Mibu turned towards the castle. There also were flames.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Hanna.” Saku said, also noticing. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We can’t save everyone.” Mibu said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“This is our last hope.” Saku picked a skull flower and put it in her bag. The bag overflowed. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We can’t…” Mibu began to say. But instead she watched as her friend obsessively placed flowers in the mermaid bag. Mibu stood. Horrified. “The field is on fire! Saku.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Yes! Hurry! Take all you can carry.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Enough of this! No More Saku! You’re going to get us hurt!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku began to stuff flowers in Mibu’s pockets. “Just believe me.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Believe me!” Mibu shouted. “You are sick!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Then be sick with me.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu saw smoke quickly rising ahead of them. She took a flower and snapped it at the stem. She took another. “Now let’s go!” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The smoke followed them until they arrived on the edge of the district. Saku stood on the street, looking back to the burning field. Flames roared high. The chatter of panic and chaos echoed throughout the city. Men ran carrying weapons, running towards the castle. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What if these are the only flowers left?” Saku thought. Slowly realizing. “If they are attacking Shao Song. They will send men to Fukui. We need to go find Ayashi and get to our village.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">They fled towards the castle at a hurried pace towards the city. They found a royal messenger and sent word to Jiro to hold the city until they returned. They escaped out into the forest, heading towards the village. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku and Mibu crept up to Ayashi’s encampment. They had traveled along the river there in hopes that he had returned to it. But instead, a lone man in blue sat on the stump where Saku had once drunk the tea. He drew no sword. He nodded at the woman, and motioned for them to sit down. They hesitated. The man showed them the palm of both hands. “I am Lord Noriko. Lord Tomodachi. I am here to talk.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The two skull women stood. With their arms crossed. Lord Noriko shrugged but did not seem concerned.  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Where is Ayashi?” Saku spoke. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Place your weapons on the ground. You have my word you will not be harmed.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku looked to Mibu. She spoke.  “You attacked the city after inviting us to a peace treaty. We can not trust you.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I did not attack.” Lord Noriko said. “The forces of the city attacked us. Lead by Jiro. Ayashi. And Hanna. They choose not to counsel you, but to try to kill us in our sleep.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No.” Saku said. “They wouldn’t do that.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“This isn’t the first time the two have done this before Saku. This is merely the echoes of a deal poorly drafted. I have paid the cost of their mistakes today. I knew you would come here. Looking for Ayashi believing he was helping you. He was helping himself.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You lie.” Saku said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“It might be unwise to lie to one who can summon thunder.” Lord Noriko said. “I only speak truth.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku put her weapons down. Mibu did the same, but reluctantly. </span>
    </p>

      <span class="c1">“You were a creation of Ayashi.” said Lord Noriko. “You were given the tea so that you would aid his cause. So that he would have an unstoppable weapon. You happened on the way, so he chose you. My spy believes this. You have caused many people harm.”</span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“My only intention is to do what is right.” Saku said. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I believe you.” Lord Noriko said, sitting up. “I would have requested to speak to you in person if they had come to surrender as I requested. But now it does not matter. The city of Shao Song is mine. Ayashi and Hanna shall be dealt with, with care. I am here to speak to you about your village.”</span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I do not recognize Rusu as head of the village. For I did not appoint them, they can not be trusted. For she was placed by Lord Yataku. That part of the world is gone. You were trying to take what originally was my daimyo of your village, a proper council with us in the coming months. I shall give the city time to regain it’s own order. We do not seek control of your people. But we do request that the tea trade is kept open only to us. I give to you my letter to read to your people stating these wishes.” He handed Saku a letter sealed in red wax. </span>

      <span class="c1">“There is one matter you should consider wisely. You and the village must destroy all the remaining skull flowers. I shall not take them from you. But you should consider your power. And what a people might do with it who have been sickened by lies.”</span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Yes.” Lord Niroko said. “Because I had to. What if there are others out there who get powers from this? Your village is no longer the keepers of the wild like they once were. Maybe not all of your village should that power.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’re telling me.” Mibu spoke. “If we trade with you, you will leave us alone?”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Yes.” He said. “If you destroy every last remaining flower. We will happily trade with you. But If you do not, we shall destroy you. We shall give you time to decide. We shall seek you when the time is right. Do I have your understanding? And your promise to council with me?”</span>

      <span class="c1">Off in the distance, waves crashed onto the Fukui shoreline. Saku and Mibu stood staring, collecting their thoughts after the day-long journey from Shao Song. The gray skies cast a shadow upon the village. Saku breathed in the salty air. The rich scent of dry cedar and pine loomed, and this calmed her spirit. The vegetation around the village somehow looked drier than it had before she left. Neither of them could remember a time where the land looked like it did. The green tea crops on the hill sides were brown and leaned heavy to the side. This was a sign that the water silo had failed to keep their crops alive. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Our people are not ready for this.” Mibu said, fidgeting with her bow string.  </span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Nor am I.” Saku bent down to rest her knees. “But we have to convince them that the northern clan means to kill everyone. We can’t let them suffer the same fate as Oni-chan. The forces will be here soon. We have to do what we can to stop people from getting hurt.” Her gaze turned to the village, which now looked so small and unimportant. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">
        “You don’t think he will keep his word?” Mibu said. “If we destroy the flower, you don’t think he will leave us alone?”
        <br/>
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No.” Saku said. </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“We should have left the village. You should never have gone to the city.” Mibu said. She cursed.</span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She took a few steps away from hillside and turned back in the direction Shao Song. Smoke still rose. As much as they both might have wished this, that they should have just left, they knew that was no longer an option. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“There is no chance.” Saku said. “These clans thirst for power and will lie, cheat and steal to get it. We saw it. All we need to do is find a way to show it to them. But I need you on my side. You are my hope. If these flowers are lost, so is our lives.” </span>

        Rusu shook her head, along with most of the rest of the village standing in the open air at the Temple. “They put the village idiot in charge.” She said.

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku’s eyes turned away from her back to her people who looked confused. Some scratched their heads, others placed their hands on their hips in disbelief. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s some way to speak to their new leader.” Kamo said from inside Saku’s pocket. “I’m hearing a lot of mumbing, are they usually like this? I’m glad you didn’t return to get hope when we first met.” </span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You have no power here anymore.” She said as loud as she could, addressing everyone who had gathered. “I am your daimyo. And the chosen leader of Shao Song. We must join with them to defeat the north and their allies. They no longer are our conquerors.”</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“No,” Saku said, fighting down her anger. She fought to keep her fists relaxed. “I. Tell what the conquerors what to do now.”</span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Maybe so.” Rusu said. “You might have fooled them, but you do not fool us. If you truly want to do what is best for us, you will at least listen to what we have to say! And I say give them the flowers!” Some people cheered in agreement.  </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“The Tamina clan of the north, and the Henashi of the northwest, only want to take control of the tea market. I have heard these words from my own ears, as a shinobi died cursing our people. They think somehow this will bring prosperity to the land. They then attacked Shao Song after agreeing to peace talks. The Tamina can not be trusted.”</span>

        “I was forced to drink the tea against my will.” Saku could hear the shifting and the uneasiness in the crowd. “But I since then, I can talk to the spirits within these bones. These are my friends. The powers are real. That is why is Lord Yataku has fallen. Because of me. And it can be yours. If you restore tradition, and drink the tea.” She looked into the eyes of the people, and then put the skulls back in her pockets. “I can summon light if I get angry. I didn’t know that when it happened.”

      <span class="c1">“I can’t summon it. I mean. I can. But I can’t control it. And I will not do anything to harm any of you. You aren’t going to believe that the skulls talk no matter what I do.” </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Ask Kamo a question, I will tell you his reply.” Saku said, again pulling Kamo out of her pocket. People gawked. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That’s not going to work.” Mibu said, shaking her head. “Let us decide for ourselves.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku took a step forward and raised her chin to speak. “These flowers are all that remain of the true us. The people we used to be. The people we still are. We can re-learn our past and tell our ancestors stories once again. We have been lied to our whole lives. Our people were not crazy. They were protectors of the wild. Our people have sworn an oath to the soil. It is time that we remember.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A young boy shook his head. He looked to his mother. “That’s the crazy tea talking.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I speak the truth!” Saku said. She backed off and looked to the sky. She drew in a deep breath. She let it out. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu felt something static surge in the air. She looked around, trying to figure out where the feeling had come from. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Without proof.” Asta spoke, “destroying the flowers is the sensible thing to do. If they kill us after, there is not much we can do.“Our past or not, the conquerors have helped us grow beyond those years. Those are people of the past. Not who we are now.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I shall not destroy my flowers.” Saku held the bag closer to herself. Asta noticed this. “I will not destroy our history.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“That was our history.” Asta said. “This is ours now.” </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Mibu.” Saku said. “Tell them. This is not the best for them. This is allowing the outside world to win. We must allow the past to teach us.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Saku.” Mibu said, biting her lip. “I. Don’t.” </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku looked away from her. “I know. I said I didn’t need your understanding. It is not fair for me to ask this of you. Is there no one who will drink this tea? Mibu. You? Please.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu stepped back and hung her head. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">No one spoke. Saku slowly backed away from the people. “Decide for yourself. I appoint Asta to manage this affair. Talk it over. Fast. And tell me what you decide. I then will consider your wishes. But I can see now. You do not understand. I’ll fight them myself.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She turned and walked towards the shore as the shadow of a large sail cast over the village. On top of the wooden boat on the top deck sat a large castle. The northern clans banners waved from all sides of the ship. Archers stood on raised platforms around the castle, holding their arrows high yelling. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu called out. “Wait!” </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku stopped. She turned around and touched her katana with her finger tips. Her face flushed of all colors. “Do not follow me. If you do not believe me.”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I tried.” Saku said. Dust kicked up behind her as she turned to leave the Temple. With the crowd looking on as she walked away towards the warship. </span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Forces holding yari’s stood at attention on the soft coastal sand as Saku approached, alone. She fought the softness as she walked, struggling to get her feet moving the closer she moved in. Until she arrived at where tidepools and waves had moistened the sand. That was enough for her to take a strong stand to face the clan of the north. She adjusted the misemono bag of skull flowers around her shoulders. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I have no advice on how to handle this fight alone.” Fushichou said. “This is far out of the scope of my knowledge.” </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">

    </p>
    <p class="c0">

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Okay everyone,” Saku said to her pockets. “I’m off to go die here, so if you can both quiet it down that would be great.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’re not going to die. Not if you keep calm, spread your wings and… oh yeah. You’re not a duck. Sorry.” Kamo said. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Greetings. Lord Tomodachi.” An older Samurai spoke. “I am Yoshio. An aid to Lord Noriko. You indeed were given time, though perhaps not the time you might have assumed. Will your village meet our demands?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Yes.” A voice said. Rusu approached carrying a sack with two skull flowers poking out.  “Here they are. We agree to your terms. That is what we have decided.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu stood in the field nearby with others. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m so sorry Saku.” She said. Ashamed. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">People of the village drew closer. Asta and Rusu were among them. They both approached Saku. She jolted back away from them. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You can not ask this of me.” Saku said, looking into the eyes of her people. They seemed like strangers now. People she no longer could communicate with. They would never believe her. They were going to destroy everything without even trying to understand anything. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Yes.” Saku said. Facing her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Hand them to Mibu.” Asta ordered. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You don’t understand what you are doing!” Saku shouted. </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu again felt static in the air. Everyone did. People shifted and looked around. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Someone take them.” Rusu shouted. She nodded to a group of men holding crud weapons. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu ran to stand in front of the men. “No.” she said. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The men tried to push aside Mibu but she stood firm.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“If you do not give them to us, we have orders to attack. Make your choice.” Yoshio said. </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“There’s other solutions to this. This can’t be the only way.” Mibu said. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“If you take a step forward” Saku said to the clan of the north. “ I will be forced to kill you.” She held the palm of her hand on her sword. “Turn back now and leave.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A samurai reached for Saku’s bag. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Shield your eyes.” Saku shouted.</span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Her fist clenched hard, she gritted her teeth. She began to scream, but instead channeled that energy to her veins. The man leapt away from her, feeling the power in the air. Without making a sound, she looked to the gray sky. A lightning bolt spilt through the clouds and struck the warship’s main castle. It burst into flames.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Told you.” Kamo said. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Samurai leaped over board, frightened. They joined the other forces on the shore, who began to move towards Saku. The surrounded her. She defended herself, blocking the men’s attacks. But the more that attack, the harder it became. With all her strength she fought as the people from her village looked on. Mibu ran, but was out of reach to aid her. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Please!” She yelled. “Stop this! Don’t make me do this!” They did not. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Another bolt cracked above them, striking many men. Other forces kept moving. Saku backed away, summoning another bolt on one of the raised platforms hitting an archer before they could release an arrow. Flames on the ship grew. Men broke ranks, and started running away from the village. Some of the people of Fukui ran to take cover. Mibu rushed to Saku’s side, releasing a shot that struck the last archer standing in flames. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">A samurai was in reach and took a jab at Saku. She blocked. With a blink of her eye, electricity came from the sky and was absorbed into the attacker's sword. The man instantly fell to the ground, lifeless. At the sight of this, the northern clan fled. Running, scattered through out the beach. Saku’s eyes followed this, but her heart sank at the sight of northern forces gathering on top of a hill from the other side of the village. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I can’t handle all of them.” She said, seeing the pure number of samurai forces. She turned to the people hiding in the field.  “For those who wish me to lead you. Head to the eastern water silo.” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Mibu ran with her towards the mountain slopes at the edge of the town. As did most everyone else. Rusu included. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Release the water!” Saku cried. The villagers rushed to the structure and began to open gates on the aqueduct, sending water gushing down the bamboo and onto the soil below. The northern clan stopped, many of the men looking to their soaked feet. They looked back up in time to hear Saku summoning thunder nearby. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Stay back!” She shouted to the warriors. Most began to retreat, but a brave few made their way up through the tea plants towards the top. She rushed down to meet them. With a swift motion struck a man’s knee with the handle of the katana. He tumbled down. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">With a blink she summoned lighting to the slope, dropping a multitude of men who had stood in the wet soil. </span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">But when Saku had called forth the thunderclap, some of the sparks had flown onto the misemono bag, causing the flower petals to go up in flames. The bag burned. She threw it off and tossed it down. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“NO!” She cried towards the bag. Thunder struck the bag, ripping it apart. Saku screamed again. A scream that echoed in the air, which had suddenly smelled moist. A bright flash came right in front of Saku. A sudden crack rang out so loud that it sent everyone, friend and foe, to their knees. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Everyone could feel tingling in their bodies. She found the bag on the ground. In flames. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“NOOOOOOO!” Saku let out a death curdling scream directed in front of her. She began to hit the ground. Thunder clapped. People sheided their eyes from all the flashing light. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">And then, for the first time in a long time, it began to rain. Giant raindrops fell to the ground. The thirsty soil quickly drank up as the rain grew heavier. The northern clan fled, back in the direction of Shao Song. </span>

      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku kept looking at the ashes that used to be the bag. Her hair and garments were soaking wet. She cried. A stream of rain fall down the hill. </span>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Trust me.” Mibu said. “Can you get up?” She held Saku to her feet. They walked together back up to the village. The rain continued to fall. </span>

They stood back in the Temple garden, looking over the tea shack where Saku had once loaded the tea to take to the conquerors. Rain beat hard against the longhouse roofs in the most wonderfully deafening way to those who had lived in drought for so long. </span>

    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Asta spoke, leaning on a fence that overlooked the pond, now filling with water. “The north might not have been completely wrong in their demands. Does anyone in this world need that kind of power? The ability to end life is a force no one should have.” </span>

      <span class="c1">Saku straightened up. “You learn so much from speaking to the spirits. To fight was not an easy choice. One I made every attempt not to make. But Lord Niroko forced my hand.”  </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Saku looked up at the dark cloudy sky. She went on. “I had forgotten my favorite part when it rains. Everything is more green. All the plants brightened up, like they had woken up on the right side of the bedroll. I think this. Power is still needed.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">Asta nodded. “I am sorry that we did not believe. But it sounded so unbelievable. It went against everything we thought we valued. I ask for forgiveness.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Forgiveness is a means of control. Though I am your leader, I do not wish to control you.” Saku said. “I will rule. I understand that might not be popular with the village. They will learn to accept it. Dissolve the relationship approver consul, the people are free to love whoever is an adult. Dissolve the schools, and teach the children something useful about living. I will need your input, Asta. I wish to listen to the people the best I can. For now I must return with Mibu. Get the forces trained, and ready defenses. Send word to us in Shao Song  if trouble comes. By bird if you must. I fear the north will not stay content for long.”</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I shall do as you wish.”  Asta bowed. “But as you said. This is going to be difficult for us. I fear Rusu will lead a resistance at some point no matter what you do. Some are thankful for what you have done. But many feel betrayed by your decision to not do as they wanted..”</span>

      <span class="c1"/>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“There’s a lot of work to be done, but work on our terms. Someday they will realize I have shown them how special they are.”</span>

      <span class="c1">Mibu heard a knock at the entrance of her home. She pulled back the bamboo sliding door. Saku stood, with a heavy pack and a walking stick. She still had her Katana on her person. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What are you doing?” Mibu said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I’m leaving. I’m going to find my friends. To make sure Oni-chan is buried. I came to tell you goodbye.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You’re not leaving without me.” Mibu said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You didn’t believe me. How can I be with you? Not after you did what you did.” Saku said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Come inside.” Mibu pulled Saku inside and shut the door. She walked across a dirt floor to a wooden box. She picked it up and handed it to Saku. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“What’s this?” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Open it.” Mibu said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">She slowly pulled the top of the box, making a scraping sound. Her eyes widened.  Suddenly she began to cry. Inside were two skull flowers. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“You did trust me.” Saku whispered. “But the two flowers that Rusu had…” </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Were Asta’s. That makes four skull flowers that have survived. I go where you go. Always.” She said. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I will find a way to grow new skull flowers. In case any of our people are someday ready. If that is what they choose.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Then let us find a way.” Mibu smiled. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">The two left Fukui the next morning. To vibrate plants and fresh morning air. The sun rose, exposing a refreshed and thriving landscape.</span>

    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“Where are we going to find them?” Mibu asked, checking her bow. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c2">
      <span class="c1"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">“I don’t know.” Saku said, peeking in her pockets checking on her skull friends. “All I know. We head north.”</span>
