<p id="page_38" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Episode 4 A What Limit?</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia sat in the driver's seat looking through the clutter of tapes, looking deep in thought. The van</span> <span class="calibre2">door slammed shut. She winced as I climbed in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t drop things. Why did I drop-” She started to say something else, but she couldn’t.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I paused. “Please don’t be sad,” I shifted in my seat. “We can take what we made back to your</span> <span class="calibre2">mom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She turned to me. “You can’t listen to anything I say. I don’t understand Aurore. Why don’t I get</span> <span class="calibre2">to know what happens to future me? Where is my future Mom? Why is future you so-”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“-Other me takes other shifts. If we beat them there, we can do this job whenever we want.</span> <span class="calibre2">Nothing else matters.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The one where everyone gets cupcakes? Are you kidding me with this? Do you understand</span> <span class="calibre2">what is happening? You’re not beating them. You are killing them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We need to hurry. None of this matters anyways. Not when that timer ends, and we get back to</span> <span class="calibre2">the reset point before-”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia began to turn the key but stopped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You aren’t understanding, Aurore,” She said, raising her voice. “I think. You don’t care about</span> <span class="calibre2">me. At all. You don’t care about anything. Not even yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s not true!” I said. “I would never! You don’t know that! We can fix this. We can work on</span> <span class="calibre2">the issues between us. With this job, we can make money whenever we want and -”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m supposed to be okay watching you kill yourself to work an eight-hour shift? Over and over?</span> <span class="calibre2">I thought we were getting better! But how can? When you’re over there, having an identical</span> <span class="calibre2">dimension death-match with yourself? For what? Future you can’t be poor. If resetting destroys</span> <span class="calibre2">the entire dimension? You are Azami the destroyer of worlds dude. Thanos has nothing on your</span> <span class="calibre2">body count!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Mia. I don’t know why the future me does anything. But… I don’t think future me means to</span> <span class="calibre2">suck. I’m still lost. When I'm lost, I do things to try to keep myself stable. You taught me how to</span> <span class="calibre2">cope. I. Think older me hurts. Because something happened to you.”</span></p>
<p id="page_39" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You.” She said. “You happened to me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Neither of us spoke. She hit the eject button on the tape in the cassette player. She looked at the</span> <span class="calibre2">handwritten label. Her hand flipped the tape around to show me the name written.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Coffee and Pizza mix.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That wasn’t the tape in there before.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We need to get going,” She said, looking into my eyes. “We got to beat traffic if we’re going to</span> <span class="calibre2">kill everyone in the universe and get the money we made from one order back to Mom. After</span> <span class="calibre2">that? With us? I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My heart sank. “Maybe my other self was right. Maybe you do just use me.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia looked as if the world crushed her spirit, and the remaining bits of joy she had been</span> <span class="calibre2">extinguished. She began to cry and started the van. The phone buzzed, sounding like a cowbell.</span> <span class="calibre2">“Eight hours are up. Shift complete. Please make your way to the reset point.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I couldn’t bare to say anything to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The PDA says this is it!” I yelled. We ran into the cabbage store, leaving the van running in the</span> <span class="calibre2">street. Getting out of the stadium in that traffic hadn't been so bad since Mia used the sidewalks.</span> <span class="calibre2">She didn’t run anyone over or anything, but we did break some traffic laws. Since the diemson</span> <span class="calibre2">was about to end and everyone was about to die we figured it would be okay.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The store near Fremont Street was literally full of cabbages for sale. They all looked the same to</span> <span class="calibre2">me. Red and green. Shelves lined with boxes of Elon’s cabbage, all with the same logo.</span> <span class="calibre2">Throughout the store, they played strange futuristic music. It was hard to hear that while fighting</span> <span class="calibre2">with the person that means the most to me in the entire realm of existence. Why couldn’t things</span> <span class="calibre2">just be okay?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“People don’t actually shop here, right?” Mia scoffed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We heard a lady in the back of the store call out to us. “You have arrived.” I guessed it was the</span> <span class="calibre2">same goggle lady from the paint party. She looked younger than I thought, wearing a t-shirt and</span> <span class="calibre2">tie with black slacks. “It’s in the back.” She didn’t look at us. She read what looked like a Future</span> <span class="calibre2">Treats employee handbook.</span></p>
<p id="page_40" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“KID!” We turned around, seeing Azami step out of a cab that had parked near the van. They</span> <span class="calibre2">stumbled towards us, hardly able to walk straight. “Donnn’t get any further. Don’t get any closer</span> <span class="calibre2">to that baaack room.” They slurred their words so much it was hard to understand them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I reached for the nearest head of cabbage and whacked Azami across the face, as hard as I could.</span> <span class="calibre2">They fell to the ground. I kept hitting them. Their device fell. Mia leapt and picked it up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Seriously, dude?” Azami stood, “This is how we are doing this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What, my other me’s you’ve killed haven’t fought back? ” The cabbage I had held broke in half</span> <span class="calibre2">on their head. I cursed at them. Repeatedly. I grabbed another.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The goggle lady didn’t look fazed by any of the fighting. She kept looking over the employee</span> <span class="calibre2">handbook. As if she’d seen this kind of thing before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I kicked my future self in the side, hearing them cough. I reached for a giant shelf filled with</span> <span class="calibre2">cabbage boxes. Pulling with all my weight I sent the heavy shelf crashing on Azami. Chunks of</span> <span class="calibre2">green and brown flew everywhere falling on top of them. Azmai’s foot kicked, trying to free</span> <span class="calibre2">themselves of the boxes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We sprinted towards the back of the store and slammed the door shut. An angry Mia crossed her</span> <span class="calibre2">arms as I locked and barricaded the entrance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You don’t think the weird lady is going to help my-other self do you?” Something felt like I was</span> <span class="calibre2">standing on the wrong side of the door. I don’t know why, but that annoying voice inside your</span> <span class="calibre2">head that tells you not to walk into oncoming traffic was screaming at me not to do what I was</span> <span class="calibre2">doing. I didn’t listen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">In the middle of the room sat a large duffel bag stuffed as full as it could get. On top, a bulb stuck</span> <span class="calibre2">out. It lit up green.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Behind those were two red boxes on a shelf, not far from a back exit, filled with what looked like</span> <span class="calibre2">gold Future Treat vouchers for the amount we had made on the orders. Labeled on them was</span> <span class="calibre2">both my and Azami’s name. At seeing this I poured all of Azami’s earnings into my box and held</span> <span class="calibre2">onto it. Mia looked very not cool with things going on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">After that I unzipped the plastic slider on the bag. USB Sticks of yellow and red, along with</span> <span class="calibre2">hundreds of dollars of bills burst out. I held up one of the bills to the light above and saw the</span> <span class="calibre2">raised printed watermark. The embedded strip ran down the length of the bill.</span></p>
<p id="page_41" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Lifting the handle, I saw the words “Property of Future Treats.” A USB stick and a necklace with</span> <span class="calibre2">a large blue diamond surrounded by a bunch of other colorless rocks fell to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The light on the duffel bag turned red. “Please return company property,” An electronic voice</span> <span class="calibre2">from within seemed to speak. “It is the employee’s responsibility to return the company earnings</span> <span class="calibre2">with the money and tracking data intact.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“How do we get out of here?” Mia said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I hesitated, realizing I was hoping Azami would be able to get out of those shelves. Why didn’t I</span> <span class="calibre2">hate them? I had every right. However, no one came. If I hadn’t become like my mom, my future</span> <span class="calibre2">self could have fought it. But I couldn't fight. Mia was right. I took a step away and paused.</span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">This</i></span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">was the only way to keep Mia safe.</i></span> <span class="calibre2">I told myself. I saw on the devices screen the option to</span> <span class="calibre2">“Reset” and end the shift.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The feeling didn’t stop. But I tapped on the PDA. Something wasn’t right. The sound was off. It</span> <span class="calibre2">hummed and clanked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The device zapped my hand. I felt it, deep in my skin. Burning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Please reduce weight.” The device demanded. “Can not reset with the amount of weight</span> <span class="calibre2">detected.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It has a weight limit? This is ridiculous, why? Maybe this isn’t supposed to be a two person</span> <span class="calibre2">job?” I asked. “How can we reduce the weight? Do we take out some of our vouchers?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“My mom needs that money!” Mia took off her shoes and threw them across the room into a</span> <span class="calibre2">cabbage box. I did the same with my shoes, missing the box. “Take off your clothes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I panicked. “I promised your mom I wouldn’t take my clothes off for money!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Just this once!” She said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She threw off her watch and took the socks off her feet. I took off the comfort hoodie, which</span> <span class="calibre2">must have been weighing us down a ton. We stood in only our sports bras and boy shorts. I hit</span> <span class="calibre2">the reset button. It shocked us again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We need to leave our share of the money.” I realized.</span></p>
<p id="page_42" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I can’t do that to my mom. I can’t. This might be the only chance I get. With. Whatever has</span> <span class="calibre2">happened in this messed up future. I won’t.” She said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Let’s take some of it.” I reasoned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia began to pace thinking. Suddenly I had the worst idea ever. “Azami’s PDA!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She took out their device. Their screen looked exactly like mine, with the button ready to be</span> <span class="calibre2">pressed to return us home. To reset both of us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We can hit the buttons at the same time.” I said. “That has to up our weight limit or whatever</span> <span class="calibre2">wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A loud thud came from the back exit door. Someone pounded from the other side. I heard my</span> <span class="calibre2">other self scream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We have to do this,” I said. “It’s the only way. To stop myself from hurting me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia looked at our vouchers, closed her eyes and hung her head. She nodded. We pressed the</span> <span class="calibre2">reset button on the screen at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Congratulations on winning your shift! You win!” Confetti burst into the air. A rumbling</span> <span class="calibre2">sounded off in the distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The devices roared and crackled louder. I heard my future self cry out from the other room.</span> <span class="calibre2">Azami had broken down the door. They stood. Looking at me, devastated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My vision turned blurry, until I saw the familiar spins of light circling towards a dark hole. Only</span> <span class="calibre2">now there were two black holes, on opposite sides of each other. I could hardly see, but Mia</span> <span class="calibre2">came into focus, holding oto n Azami’s PDA in the air. She headed towards a different dark hole</span> <span class="calibre2">thing than I did. And then I saw a flash. She was gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Flames engulfed, wherever we were. My future self screamed, in pain. Things got cold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Welcome back to your timeline!” The PDA said, “This reset has been sponsored by Bobs</span> <span class="calibre2">Apples! Have a free apple on us!”</span></p>
<p id="page_43" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“No. No. No!” I found a way to stand up. The van sat in the roundabout with the engine and</span> <span class="calibre2">headlights on. I held the duffel bag and the box of money.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Everything looked the same as before we left our universe. Except, Mia was not there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Bob knows apples like how the sunset knows the Grand Canyon,” The PDA continued.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Hey,” I heard a voice say. “Azami Chandler.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I turned. The worker from the cabbage store stood on the sidewalk nearby.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yes. I am Aurore Chandler,” I answered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m here to pick up the duffel bag.” She rubbed her thumb across her fingers, waiting for me to</span> <span class="calibre2">comply. “Congrats on winning the shift.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Where’s Mia?” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Future Treats is not responsible for lost items. Hand over the bag please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I paused. “No. I want my friend back. And my other self. And everyone in the universe.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You should have picked better.” She grabbed the bag out of my hands. “Thank you for working</span> <span class="calibre2">for Future Treats.” She left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">What kind of sick game was this?</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">After rolling the van quietly back into the Ms. Kaye’s garage, I stepped out and put the keys in</span> <span class="calibre2">my pocket. I adjusted the money box. And then. Without thinking, I slammed the van door.</span> <span class="calibre2">Again. ‘Cause I can’t do a single thing right. But I wasn’t thinking. I couldn’t think. I couldn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">breathe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kay rushed from the kitchen, in the black night gown as she had before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Rory? What are you doing in my garage? With Bicana’s van? Where is Mia?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I gasped. I thought to myself,</span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">hold it together, Aurore. Hold it together</i></span><span class="calibre2">.</span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">Mia is gone. There is a</i></span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">way to fix this.</i></span></p>
<p id="page_44" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">Wait. But other Ms. Kaye is dead.</i></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I bit my lip to avoid crying.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Aurore? Aurore, I need you to speak to me. What are you doing here?” The real Ms. Kaye said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know, I swear.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What happened?” She said. “What’s inside that box in your hand?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I gave it to her. “You don’t have to go to work anymore. Mia wanted to make sure of that. She</span> <span class="calibre2">wanted this for you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I choked. What do you do with that? This PDA sucks and Mia.. is gone? ‘Cause I’m dumb? And</span> <span class="calibre2">I choose this? But we got a free apple! There’s no chance of explaining that horrifying situation</span> <span class="calibre2">to any kind of normal person. But this wasn’t a normal thing going on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She took a step towards me. “Is this some kind of prank? Sour milk in a locker is one thing, but</span> <span class="calibre2">this is theft. Kidnapping? We could press charges. How did you get in here? How did you get the</span> <span class="calibre2">keys, did you take them?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I tried to think what to do next but... I had nothing. This is when I’d ask Mia what to do. But I</span> <span class="calibre2">couldn’t. I had an overwhelming thought. Had I ever known what to do on my own? Do I not</span> <span class="calibre2">make my own choices and stuff?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Aurore?” Ms. Kaye looked at the strange object I held in my hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I thought long and hard, realizing I had to tell her. I had no other choice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Or not.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I didn’t know what “or not” was at the time, but I picked it. To my shock though, pressing “start</span> <span class="calibre2">shift” on the screen did nothing. My finger jabbed at the start text over and over, trying to start a</span> <span class="calibre2">shift to go find her, to figure something out. It didn’t work. I stood there, in front of a very</span> <span class="calibre2">concerned and angry Ms. Kaye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I have to go. Keep the money.” I said.</span></p>
<p id="page_45" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Where is she?” She asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I looked into her eyes. That’s where those specks came from.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m sorry,”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kaye ran after me as I left the open garage. I ran into the dark on foot, with nowhere to go.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I tried to sleep for a while in the park behind some bushes after everyone had left the glow party.</span> <span class="calibre2">Most of the time I lay there thinking about how Mia wasn’t coming to save me. Looking across</span> <span class="calibre2">the desert, I tried to count how many colors I could see as the sun rose. Not many. (My eyes also</span> <span class="calibre2">suck pretty bad.) I knew I should have been doing something to better my situation or whatever,</span> <span class="calibre2">but I didn’t. I sat there. Like Azami did. I kind of felt I understood them better. Even though how</span> <span class="calibre2">they had been living was. Iffy is a nice way to put it I guess.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I stood up from the ground. The light all flicked behind me and stuff. I headed to the bus stop</span> <span class="calibre2">down the street.</span></p>
