<p id="page_113" class="calibre7">Episode Five</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I could be daimyo.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna patted her bare skin with Oni-chans cloth. She looked different without her makeup, more sophisticated than expected. Her kimono shifted on her shoulders as she tugged at the collar.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You would need control of the workers,” She said. “and the armed forces. We don’t have that. The Tamina clan of the north are cruel and will destroy your village the first chance they get. Lord Niroko is not merciful like Lord Yataku was.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Really, she can’t be any worse than the last guy.” Oni-chan said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku slowly paced back and forth in the hut. She felt herself checking her pockets, making sure the skulls were still in their place. “But I’m the idiot. I can’t make right decisions, how am I going to know what’s best for that many people? And, this is our chance to rule ourselves. For the first time in a hundred years. ”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna shook her head. “This is only going to make matters worse. Yes, I could help you and yes the people respect me. The ones who don’t want me crucified think I’m okay anyways.” She muttered. Her elbows dug into the bamboo table as she put her hands on her chin hard. She sighed deeply with a pained expression on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“When Lord Niroko finds what we are doing,” She went on “know our heads will be removed, cleaned up and dressed up for everyone to see. So if we do this, make sure you look your best.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I do not want to become someone’s talking head!” Saku shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Sparks appeared in the air. As soon as she raised her voice, everyone in the room jumped back. She stopped and looked to the sky, spreading her arms out wide as if she could do something if thunder crashed down. Nothing happened. She repeated herself. Calmly. Everyone returned to where they were standing before.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You were serious.” Oni-chan said. “In that case, I am with you. My head would look good on a display.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna closed her eyes. “Tenma was a regular at the kissing house. Yataku’s samurai shall listen to him. We will need his help to rally the left over forces to take the castle. To show the people some legitimacy of your clan. Your divine powers should help.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan clapped his hands together excitedly. “You could be Emperor! I think we have one… Bukofu or something? But who cares! You can claim divine right!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Good thought, but let’s keep it simple.” Hanna said.</p>
<p id="page_114" class="calibre7">Saku waved Oni-chan off and walked around the water barrel. “I can’t even be in charge of my finances. I got sad once and ate an entire week's wages. Get Ayashi. How can we call on him? The city can rally around him!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“If Lord Yataku is dead, then he is gone.” Hanna said. “ My father is angry at him. He likes his head attached, he tells me often. If you, and your gift do not help us no one will. And they come for the village next.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You mean he would leave us? After cursing me?” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s pretty typical.” Hanna said. “You. Are the only one who can help us.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I did not have “take over Shao Song” in my spirit reading this week.” Oni-chan stated. “I shall spread the word, and I will gather everyone and bring them to the front gate of the castle.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna reached out her hand to Saku’s. “If not you, then who?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Kamo coughed from inside the pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“How can you cough if you don’t breathe air?” Saku asked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Being as out touch as you are with your past and culture and knowing nothing about yourself and all that, is this a good idea?” Kamo asked. “WIth great power comes the ability to roast people like a rice cracker. This could get a lot of people hurt if you don’t use it right.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Fushichou agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku bit her lip, trying to numb the sensation of dread. She took Kamo from his pocket and spoke to him. “It feels like a lot of people are going to be hurt no matter what we do.” Saku said. “I told Mibu I would not let her down. I won't back out of that now.” She said. Hanna and Oni-chan looked at each other, uneasy while she spoke to the object in her palm.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I do not agree with this plan.” Kamo said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“There has to be more diplomatic solutions.” Fushichou added.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku placed Kamo back in the pocket, and turned to the two. She nodded firmly. “Let’s find Tenma.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Kamo quacked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Language.” Fushichou warned.</p>
<p id="page_115" class="calibre7">***</p>
<p class="calibre7">The two story wooden structure had the smoothest walls Saku had ever seen. Its pointed roof was tightly woven with thatch, its wood unblemished. The camellia flowers were so brightly yellow that they could be seen in dimly lit city lights. She marvolved at the artisanal compound. The scent of rain clouds rushed past them in a chilling breeze. Saku held up a lantern, with an Oni-chan face painted on it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Only one family lives here?” Saku asked as they waited at the sliding door. “How can they afford it? Do they work a lot of extra shifts at the fields or whatever they do?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Nobles don’t have to worry about money.” Fushichou said. “They don’t have to work for anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The idea of not working was hard for the villager to wrap her head around, having been used to strict routines of labor. A memory came to her mind of receiving her monthly rice rations that had been halved. She had worried how she was going to survive without food. Did these men not worry like that?</p>
<p class="calibre7">A servant came to the door to answer for Tenma, wearing a light red garment with a long sash around the front. They were led to the second level to a room with a giant open window, letting in the night air. A garden filled with Azalea flower beds and tall potted fruiting trees thrived inside the room.</p>
<p class="calibre7">A man entered the garden from the other side. Light shone off the top of his shaved head, his back hair unruly in an up knot. He adjusted his clothing, trying to hide the scar on his neck from them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“My condolences, Lady Yataku. I received word that he has passed on.” Tenma put a hand on her shoulder. “I understand things were difficult between you and Yataku.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s one way to put it.” Hanna removed Tenma’s hand from her shoulder. Saku could see a tear roll off the corner of her eye.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We need your support.” Saku said. “With Hanna’s help, I am going to rule the city. So I get this is sudden, and you don’t know me. But if you believe…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Oh, spare me your attempt at politics.” Tenma said, waving his hand into the air dismissively. “If it is for my lady, then you have my support. I do not care that you are a slave. It is time for that way of life to end. Lord Noriko will aim to capture the castle as fast as he can. We must gather everyone and…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">An arrow whistled through the air. Tenma grabbed at the shaft that lodged itself into his chest. He tried to breathe. Hanna and Saku took cover behind the pots as another arrow struck him.</p>
<p id="page_116" class="calibre7">His body fell to the ground, on top of a bed of flowers. Peering over her cover, Saku spotted a darkly clothed man standing by the window welding a longbow with gold engravings. The man’s eyes widened. He pulled the string back and aimed in Saku’s direction. The tip cut through the air sharply. Saku spun to the other side of the pot. It struck the fabric on her back, ripped it and cut her skin. Saku screamed with all her might facing towards the attacker from behind cover.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Thunder cracked. She turned to shield her eyes from the flash. Hanna tried to do the same, but could not. Her brown eyes met with the thunderbolt in front of her that ripped through the complex and struck near where the attacker stood. He dropped, and cried out face first into the floor. He laid on his side and curled into a ball, grabbing at the burn marks at his side.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku approached him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That is your power?” Hanna asked Saku, not moving. “You did that?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Who are you?” Saku asked the man lying on the ground, not noticing Hanna hunched over with her eyes closed tight. His feet were kicking, randomly as if he could not control them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“When the Skullers are destroyed.” The attacker gritted his teeth as he spoke. “The Tamina will control all the tea. My family gets to live. That make’s both our deaths worth it.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Dark smoke filled the room. Sparks had ignited the wood of the flower beds, sending flames reaching towards the Tenma clan banner. Hanna tried to walk over to Saku as the fire grew, but she stumbled.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You work for my Father. You Shinobi. ” She said to the attacker. The man let out a final breath.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Tears from Hanna’s red eyes streamed down her cheeks. Her pupils had turned mostly cloudy white. Saku say them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What did I do?” Saku gasped.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Everything is cloudy. Help me out of here. Fast. Where there is one Shinobi, they are others nearby.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku helped Hanna leave the building, hearing frantic voices from within the compound. The air grew cold, colder than any night before it. A breeze swept through the city, causing the clouds of smoke to drift. She felt her hands tremble again.</p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre13">Can I use this power without hurting someone?</i> She thought.</p>
<p class="calibre7">–</p>
<p id="page_117" class="calibre7">When they had left and were sure they hadn’t been followed, they ducked behind a yakitori-ya restaurant. Saku could still smell the grilled meat. She wrinkled her nose in disgust.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Tenma was our only hope.” Hanna said. She held a hand to her forehead. Her eyes did not move. “We have no way to gain our forces' trust.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Kamo laughed. “I told you running into things without plans doesn’t work.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Shut up Kamo.” Saku said. “Is there anyone in Lord Yataku’s samurai unit that would help us?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Jiro and Bokoni are the only ones. But Bokoni used to serve Noriko before the land was given to the Zumono clan. Though Jiro could lead the remaining men, He was loyal to Yataku, and therefore I am not his best friend so to speak.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">A bowl from inside the empty restaurant fell on the ground, letting out a loud CLANK. Saku jumped and drew her katana. A cat with it’s back arched slowly backed away the bowl. She sighed and returned the sword to its place.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You’ve gotten yourself in deep in this one.” Kamo said from inside her pocket. “I hope Hanna’s blindness is temporary. ‘Cause that would suck.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It is questionable.” Fushichou said. “If you fail, you will die. As will the others.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Can everyone give me a second here?” Saku said, patting her pockets.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna reached out, feeling her. When she found her, she drew closer to Saku.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“He is our only choice.” Saku said. “We head to the outpost.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">–</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Hanna. You can not ask this of me.” A man with long gray hair spoke, rather harshly. His age could be seen in the wrinkles of his face, and his arm struggled to hold the weapon he was cleaning steady. His nostrils flared from the smell of fire from the cooking pits still burning.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’m not doing this for me.” Saku said. “I’m doing this for everyone in Shao Song.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">He wiped the blade of his Yari and turned to the remaining tents in the outpost. Where there once had been stationed a thousand men were now only two hundred. The samurai who left when word arrived the regent had been killed and brought none of their belongings along as they fled into the night. Jiro searched another abandoned tent, gathering any weapon he could find. Saku led Hanna as he walked.</p>
<p id="page_118" class="calibre7">“Why should I trust a tea slave?” He knelt, feeling the cold metal of a sword left in the dirt. He wiped it with a cloth and took it with him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We… aren’t slaves.”Saku said. “We are in debt to you conquerors who stopped us from drinking the tea …” She stopped speaking. She swallowed hard and paced back and forth, left to right in front of the man. “We are slaves, aren’t we?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna took a step toward.s Jiro who closed the flap on a tent and wandered to another. “Our choices are to fall to the north, or take the city. All we need to do is go get it.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Is that all?” Jiro sneered. “Walk straight in? Should we knock first? You tell me how this works Hanna. These men are hungry, and their morale is low. If you wanted to help, you would start picking up weapons so we can sell them and buy those who survived the northern siege of Chinoki.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’ve stopped a man’s heart tonight. And caught a house on fire” Saku said. “With your leadership, we can do anything if we work together.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You? You are the one who killed Lord Yataku?” Jiro blew out his cheeks before throwing a pile of weapons at his own tent.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Totally wasn’t on purpose. I didn’t know I could do that. I screamed and lightning came out of the sky, and…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Traitor!” One of the samurai shouted from nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“She also killed Ito and his son.” Said another.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She addressed the crowd of warriors who gathered. The men looked tired, and thin. “This was not my plan. I do not wish to take life. I want to do what’s best for everyone, but I can’t do it myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">From behind a rack filled with stored weapons near the tent, Jiro pulled a wooden training sickle. He showed the weapon to Saku and nodded. She shrugged, confused. He tossed it at her.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Fight me. Slave.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She looked at the sickle. “I can’t even cut grass with this.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No one is cutting grass.” Jiro said. “You are no warrior. I can not fight with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Why are we fighting with farm equipment? Mibu always beats me when I spar with her like this. What does this prove?”</p>
<p id="page_119" class="calibre7">“We don’t have time for this,” Hanna said. “The north might already be in the castle, we need everyone to go with us. I know a secret path that only a few know. We might be able to force our way in.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku and Jiro turned to one another, realizing she could see less than they thought. Hanna held out her hands in front of her while her white pupils struggled to see the shadows in front of it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I know what you’re thinking, but I can see a little. I can lead you in the right direction. If we make it in time, we can recruit those remaining in the castle to our cause.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku pulled Kamo out, as if he were a worry stone. “Are you with us?” She asked Jiro.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Well of course I am. I’m starting to feel at home in that pocket.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Not you Kamo! Sorry, I was talking to the skull.” She said to Jiro.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He stared hard at the woman before turning to the dimly lit castle on top of the forested hill. Tall grass near them waved back and forth in the cool breeze.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I want no part in this slaughter,” He said. “Leave before it's too late.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">A man rushed into the training grounds, frantic and calling out. “The Tamina clan of the north have sent their forces to the market district! And the Henashi clan of the Northwest have taken the bridge by the Misemono! Jiro you need to do something!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Jiro lowered his eyes. “I’m too old for this. This is a death trap.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’m going to the castle.” Saku said. “With anyone who wants to go with me. You can be a part of why people die. Or you could help all of us find a way to live. Let’s go Hanna.” Saku led Hanna in the direction of the castle on the hill. A few warriors joined them. Most of the gather crowd did not.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Jiro cursed as they disappeared into the night.</p>
<p class="calibre7">***</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku removed brown tree needles from her between her toes. The dense conifer trees and steep rocky terrain made traveling difficult for the Tomodachi forces. They made their way slowly upward. The climb felt much longer than it looked.</p>
<p id="page_120" class="calibre7">“If we are where I think we are.” Hanna said. “The gate to the back tunnel path should be up ahead. Someone should make sure it’s clear before we proceed.” A few men in blood soaked clothing and patch work armor left the group to scout up ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre7">After several minutes they returned. “There’s no one in the garden.” One told Hanna. “They must all have gone to the main castle.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Garden?!” Hanna exclaimed. “We need to go east. I have led us astray.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What garden?” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It is of no importance.” She said, “Let’s press on.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna stood and gently reached for Saku’s hand. She motioned with her head for her to follow. After they walked along a path, they found by lantern light a gate built of stacked stones that created an arch. Beyond it, in the distance, stood the white castle.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Keep going.” Hanna told the men, struggling to transport the weapons attached to their backs through the thick of the forest. She also took hold of one of the men’s shoulders with her other hand.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Something in her voice gave Saku pause. Ignoring her grip, she pointed the light at an entrance to a stoned off area.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Is this the garden?” Saku asked, walking inside.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna tried to pull her along, but she left and entered. “Wait!” Hanna yelled.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Inside Saku found herself in a field of tall flowers. The plant's stalks were tall and husky, and the middle of the red blossom was a white hard seed, shaped like a skull. Red mushrooms grew at the base of the plant, surrounded by animal bones. Saku reached out, standing on her tippy toes, to gently feel the plant she had only heard before.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“These. Were my peoples flowers? The source of the crazy tea?” Saku asked, as a man guided Hanna inside. She remembered the conquerors checking their belongings when she was growing up, looking for seeds even one hundred years later after the take over. Saku had always assumed they were doing this out of the kindness of their heart so that their people could function away from the insanity their way of life brought. Holding the flower in her hands she realized nothing about the way she lived was done out of concern. It was to silence their power.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They're so beautiful.” Saku was able to say. Her mouth hung open. “This is what made the tea that I carried from Fukui.”</p>
<p id="page_121" class="calibre7">“No.” Hanna said. “That is tea from another flower. Purchased from the Misemono. No one is the wiser. Yataku wanted to keep the flower away the village. Now I can see why.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She saw tears in Saku’s eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I have only dreamed of seeing these.” She pulled one down towards her and felt its soft petals on her face. She went on, releasing the flower, and suddenly grasping her necklace. “My mother said she saw one once. On the only night I got to see her. Before they took her away. She refused to tell me where she saw them, in case I went looking for them. But I never have left the village. Why are they growing these still?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna looked down. “To warn what the Zumono clan would do if they were ever crossed. For a long time. It worked. Come on, I still need your eyes.” Hanna said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Why did you try to keep me from these?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She did not answer her question. She simply said: “The castle isn’t far. We need to move.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Before leaving Saku took two flowers and placed them inside the misemono bag.</p>
<p class="calibre7">***</p>
<p class="calibre7">Once they had passed the fields, they headed east until they found the tunnel. They climbed through the rocky hand dug path up to a raised stone piled platform that stretched the entire length of the foothill. Beyond tree’s above stood the painted white castle, with its four levels with slanted roofs, painted very dark blue. Dim light shown through a multitude of silt windows on the lower half.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“How are we supposed to get in from down here? I thought you knew a way to get in.” A samurai asked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I told you I knew a way to the castle, No one said anything about getting in.” Hanna spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku approached the platform and took hold of one of its stones, testing its sturdiness. “This is no bigger than a black pine. I can get in and find out what’s going on.” She found a foothold and began to climb.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Are you insane! You’re going to fall to your death! I’m not ready to die again!” Kamo said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I climb these all the time.” She said. Her right hand slipped as she tried to pull herself up, which caused her to lean back. Quickly she found a hold and steadied herself.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“All the time?” Fushichou asked.</p>
<p id="page_122" class="calibre7">“Every once in a while.” Saku admitted.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Slowly, carefully moving up and sideways, she found a secure hold on the boulders and cracks of the platform until she came to a narrow window. She leaned in, palming her left hand, to peek inside. A candle burned from the other side of the small room, filled with bundles of arrows that hung from the wall from leather straps. She struck the wooden bar on the window as hard as she could, but it did not move.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Using the windows ledge as a foot hold, she leveraged herself up. With her other leg she kicked at the bar, making a loud thump.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s a lot of noise you are making.” Kamo said. “You’re going to alert…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Before Kamo could finish speaking Saku had found a hold and lifted herself up, using all her strength so that her feet dangled below her. Using both legs, she kicked cause the wood to crack, sending pieces crashing down to the stone floor. Her fingers slipped, and she felt herself falling. She desperately reached for something to hold. Somehow before falling helplessly below, her fingers caught the edge of the ledge. She dangled for a moment, panting, her face flush. Frantically, she fought to pull herself up and over the window into the room. After positioning herself sitting below the window, she tried to regain her breath.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Well. They know you are here.” Kamo said. Saku drew her katana and stood to her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The halls were quiet. The rooms, decorated with armor displays and pottery, were lit but empty.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Where is everyone?” Saku whispered.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You should open the front and get everyone inside.” Kamo said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Suddenly a voice rang out in the halls.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You really don’t have to tug on my ear. OUCH! THAT HURTS!” It said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That sounds like Ayashi?” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Get moving.” Another voice cried.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku turned in time to see Ayashi thrown hard to the tatami mat in a large room next door. She looked up to see someone standing in the shadow of a wood sculpture of a Warrior. The figure held a long bow with an arrow drawn, pointing at Ayashi. She walked into the room and stood at a safe distance away in the shadow of the Zumono family banner. Ayashi looked hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She clenched her fist and gritted her teeth, her eyes pointed in the direction of his capturer. Sparks flew. But then she thought of Hanna. Out there. Blind and helpless. And the building had caught fireearlier. As much as she wanted to, seeing the figure in the shadow, she did use her power. She loosened her grip and calmed herself.</p>
<p id="page_123" class="calibre7">“Where is Saku?” The voice cried after a moment of silence. “Or the Ronin dies.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The figure stepped into the light. Saku’s hands shook. “MIBU!” she cried.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“SAKU!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku ran to Mibu and jumped on her, wrapping her legs and arms around her. They hugged each other tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I thought you had been killed! I left to look for you when you didn’t return. I tracked you to the camp, the Misemono. I heard you were wanted then, everything in the outside world went crazy. It is chaos out there.” Mibu cried.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I almost killed you.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Ayashi remained on the ground. “I’m not the bad guy here, I’m on your side.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I told you, not to speak unless I tell you to!” Mibu said, turning in his direction.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“She jumped me. And took me captive. From behind! That woman is crazy!” He said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Silence!” Mibu yelled. “We’ve been here for hours, where is everyone? What is going on? What’s that in your pocket?” Mibu began to reach into Saku’s pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“NO!” Saku said. But Mibu took the object out anyway. Saku tried to reach to take it back, but Mibu held her hand away.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Oh it’s you!” Kamo said, now in Mibu’s hand. “I remember you. You were in the market district one day. You fed some of your onigiri when I was alive.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu looked at the duck skull in horror. She dropped the skull. Saku fell to her knees to save Kamo from falling to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What is this, Saku? Why do you have this? Like you’re a tea drinker?” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“His name is Kamo. A spirit speaks from within this skull. That of a duck who lived in this area. A duck you shared your Onigiri with when you were in the market district.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu stared at her friend in disbelief. “I told you that story.” She said. “What madness are you speaking?”</p>
<p id="page_124" class="calibre7">“You have to trust me. There are some things I have learned about myself that are going to be very hard to believe.” Saku pulled a skull flower from her bag and presented it to Mibu. “There are a lot of things we were told that are wrong.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Put that away.” Mibu said, turning around in shame. “Why do you have that? You would anger the conquerors with that behavior! We are not to…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Do not speak their names like that.” Saku said. “They were not our friends, as they are now. There is nothing wrong with me. For once everything is right and I have found a way to fix everything.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What did you do? Why are you talking like this? ” Mibu spoke. Her eyes were closed.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I forced her to drink the tea.” Ayashi said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No one else has to know.” Mibu said, reaching for Saku’s hand. “We can heal you Saku. Let’s get you home.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No. We are here to take over this city.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu looked at Saku hard, putting her hand to her side. “This isn’t like you.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“But it is.” She said. “This is the real me. I didn’t know. We were lied to. We are freeing the village.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Free? We aren’t slaves we are free. We have a conqueror ruler, what are you talking about? We have two hours a day to do whatever we want!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We are not. I accidentally killed Yataku and messed up his military advisor's head. We decided the town should belong to the people.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu dashed swiftly to Saku and got in her face. “Not only did you drink the forbidden tea, but you are now crazy enough to think you can create a political coup?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Pounding echoed through the walls.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s coming from the front gate.” Mibu said, “quick get the prisoner…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku turned to where Ayashi had been. He had vanished. Mibu narrowed her brow.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I am a fool. Let’s get out of here.” Mibu reached for Saku’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The two found an opening that looked out to the large arch that led from the forest road to the castle. A multitude of people stood, holding torches shouting.</p>
<p id="page_125" class="calibre7">“What are they saying?” Mibu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">As they listened and watched from the room above, they began to recognize the words the crowd was chatting. Oni-chan and others from the Misemono stood along with them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Long live Tomodachi.” They cried. Saku squinted, and recognized the girl and his brother standing next to Jiro, who stood tall holding his weapon high.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Why are they saying this?” Mibu asked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku’s mouth twisted as she rubbed her fingers together, as if to check if she were awake. “I. Am your daimyo now.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You are delusional.” Mibu said. But Saku stepped out so that the crowd could see her below. Cheers erupted from the people. She saw Hanna and the other forces make their way to join the crowd. Mibu’s jaw dropped and Saku raised her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“As first order as your daimyo.” She shouted to them. “Fukui and all slaves are free.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu, though baffled, shrugged. “Well. Okay then. You might be crazy. But I’m not going to complain.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Hail Emperor Tomodachi!” A voice cried out.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’m not crazy. I can shoot lightning from the sky. But I can’t show you. I can’t hurt you like I've hurt others.” The realization came over her face as she spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Sure you can shoot lightning from your eyes.” Mibu said, softly patting her on the shoulder. As if her friend had too much sake to drink on a day off from the fields.”Have you eaten since you became a tea drinker? Maybe the grain from the rice will soak up the wacky juice in your stomach.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Strange music began to play from below the forest path. Dark toned flutes rang out. Everyone stepped back, to allow a small band of men coming on the path towards the castle. A single man stood in front of them, holding a message and a torch. Saku and Mibu left, and ran through the castle to the gate below to join the others. They walked to the group. Jiro and his warriors surrounded Saku. A man held out a red wax seal with the northern clan symbol stamped on it.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Lord. Tomodachi. And Lady Hanna.” The man said. “Lord Noriko wishes to speak to you, at a neutral site. The letter also describes the wishes of some samurai who were protecting Lord Yataku. They wish to join our clan.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Jiro looked at Hanna, who frowned. “What is this?”</p>
<p id="page_126" class="calibre7">The man approached Hana. Jiro began to draw his weapon, but Saku motioned for him to halt.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“This is to find a peaceful agreement on your cities surrender. We have made a treaty with the Northwestern clan. The region was given to us in this agreement. We wish for a peaceful transition of power.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan took hold of a large club, with pieces of metal sticking through. Others in the crowd did the same.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“The emperor will approve.” He said. “There is no use in resisting. Shao Song belongs to the Tamina clan.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It belongs to us.” Saku said. Approaching. “The city is of its people. Not Lord Noriko.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The man looked at Saku for a moment. But turned back to Hanna. “We await your reply and cooperation. As do the rest of Yataku’s men who left the castle and joined us.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hana’s eyes met Saku’s. The woman seemed as if she had been in that moment before. She spoke, still looking at Saku. “I shall meet Lord Noriko as he wishes. But we shall not give up this city.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Lord Noriko will look forward to your presence.” The man said. They left.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu lowered her head. “There is no chance the army of this city can match the north if some of their forces have surrounded them. We have no chance.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Kamo and Fushichou have gotten me this far. They will help us.” Saku pulled both skulls out from her pockets.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We are not gods Saku.” Fushichou spoke. “We are just spirits.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Put it away.” Mibu said, dismissively. Mibu hung her head and walked back towards the castle.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna was led to Saku. She crossed her arms. “Jiro said you saved his grandkids. He knew not of this before.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She paused. “You know. If both of you had the power of the tea, there’s no way anyone could stop us.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“She doesn’t believe me.” Saku said.</p>
<p id="page_127" class="calibre7">Hanna’s eyes looked out deep into the night. “I have failed you. If I could have led you here quicker I might have been able to talk the remaining men into staying and fighting with us. You must find a way to show her. Tomorrow, I will find a way to end this.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku looked in despair at Hanna. “You can’t see because of something I did. I can’t risk hurting her. And she is never going to believe me. We need to get away from this castle. I don’t know who thought this was a good idea, but if we are attacked by two armies we would be trapped here.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hanna grinned. “Well. Look at you making smart decisions.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Let’s make sure everyone gets something to eat first.” Saku said.</p>
