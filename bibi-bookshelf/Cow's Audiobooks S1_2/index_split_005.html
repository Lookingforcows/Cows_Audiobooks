<p id="page_46" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Episode 5 There are no Cupcakes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Class chatter echoed through the halls of the school. Paper pumpkins and witches swayed on</span> <span class="calibre2">clips from the ceiling. It looked like a typical day. Most of the kids had been herded like cattle</span> <span class="calibre2">between classes already. I used my hands to comb my hair as I walked toward locker 88b. An</span> <span class="calibre2">ugly steel locker with chipped blue paint and vents so tiny it’s hard to leave a note in it sat in</span> <span class="calibre2">front of me. We couldn’t figure out how to get notes out, so we left a few of them. It blocked the</span> <span class="calibre2">sour milk and candy pumpkin smell from the outside world if nothing else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I turned the combination to 01 24 75 and the locker creaked open. My nostrils flared at the sour</span> <span class="calibre2">smell as I picked up a CD case from inside. I flipped through the albums.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">Next time I see you, I’ll have a CD you like,</i></span> <span class="calibre2">I thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia wasn’t gone. She’s just not here. That’s what I told myself, she was out there. In a</span> <span class="calibre2">dimension somewhere I couldn’t reach. I needed to find a way to take another shift. I needed to</span> <span class="calibre2">bring her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">From instinct I tried putting the CD case in my hoodie pocket, but I wasn’t wearing my hoodie.</span> <span class="calibre2">The one thing that always comforted me, was now gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Something I didn’t recognize lay on top of a bunch of crumpled notebook paper. I picked up the</span> <span class="calibre2">flier and pencil shavings fell out onto the laminate floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The flier read, “Hello, Winner! Come work with us again! Find an Elon’s Cabbage to recharge</span> <span class="calibre2">your “P.D.A”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Why did the flier have quotes around “PDA”? My other self had called it a phone. Elon’s</span> <span class="calibre2">cabbage was not a thing I ever remembered before any of this crazy stuff started happening. I</span> <span class="calibre2">assumed the location might be the same place as it was in 2022.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I dug around in the locker. I thought I had some onion dip chips in there, but I didn't.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Aurore! You’re supposed to be in class. Get going.” I heard from behind me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah. No, Ms. Trinity,” I said. “I just got out of a job that devalues you as a person. That way</span> <span class="calibre2">they can take whatever they want from you. School didn’t seem to work out for me either. So.</span> <span class="calibre2">I’m out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A voice came across the intercom. “Aurore Chandler, please come to the front office.”</span></p>
<p id="page_47" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I looked outside. Two police cars drove into the parking lot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yup. I’m not doing that.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Trinity stood between me and the other exit. “You’re coming with me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Like. No.” My fingers clenched around the CD case.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I kept walking. Ms. Trinity followed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Don’t take another step.” She said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Trust me, Ms. Trinity. What I’m dealing with right now, you do not want any part of.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Trinity grabbed me by the arm. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Can you like, not?” I ripped my arm out of her hold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She came at me to grab my arm again, and I ran. All the way to the end of the hall. Our steps</span> <span class="calibre2">echoed. I reached the exit and pushed against the lever thing-y and I continued running.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I headed back towards the bus stop. Ms. Trinity stood, watching me run.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It’s not working because you need to charge before you can take another shift.” The employee</span> <span class="calibre2">explained. I found the Future Treats sign up on Fremont Street. I recognize the employee as the</span> <span class="calibre2">woman from the rest point. She looked like she hadn’t slept in ages.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You made money, right? If I made as much as you did? I’d invest it. Why would you take</span> <span class="calibre2">another shift?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why haven’t you worked a shift?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You can’t take a job without facing an older or younger you. I couldn’t kill my future or past</span> <span class="calibre2">self. Having to look in my face and say ‘‘I’m here for the money Brooke?’ I couldn’t do it to</span> <span class="calibre2">myself. Could you? Oh. Yeah. You could uh?’”</span></p>
<p id="page_48" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Something in her eyes made me think she had often thought of this scenario. That’s why her eyes</span> <span class="calibre2">froze. She brushed back the hair on her neck and went on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“No thanks. Well, if you want another shift, I can charge the phone up for you. It’s going to take</span> <span class="calibre2">a while though, like a minute.” She shuffled papers on the desk before taking the PDA from my</span> <span class="calibre2">hands. With the flick of a wrist, she flung the phone over her shoulder, which clunked against a</span> <span class="calibre2">metal pan at the bottom of a bin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“How do I find my friend?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You don’t.” The Future treats employees shrugged. “That dimension is destroyed. Gone.</span> <span class="calibre2">Everyone’s dead. You can’t go back to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I. Killed everyone?” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She nodded. I have no words to describe what I felt realizing the pain I caused. The loss. I put</span> <span class="calibre2">my feelings aside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“They weren’t in that dimension. She pressed the device at the same time as I did. She drifted</span> <span class="calibre2">into another. I don’t know what. Somewhere far from me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You’re talking about the light show after you get sucked in. Your friend is in another dimension.</span> <span class="calibre2">Did you restarted your device yet?” Brooke leaned in a little. Now interested. Her ears perked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know what a restart is. The phone kept talking about cabbage.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s good. Kind of. Your odds of finding your friend in an identical dimension are better. But</span> <span class="calibre2">not great. The device looks at the recent locations in RAM to determine which data farm, or</span> <span class="calibre2">dimension, to send the worker to. It helps the delivery algorithm pick more stable universes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The bin the lady had thrown my phone in lit up red. She frowned. “Actually, This phone’s battery</span> <span class="calibre2">is toast and needs replaced. But when I cut the power, it kills the memory in the RAM. I can try</span> <span class="calibre2">to pull that dimensional location point from the RAM, but the data is fragile. Since it’s stored in a</span> <span class="calibre2">temporary drive. The device generates incredible amounts of possible dimension location points.</span> <span class="calibre2">This fills up the temporary RAM fast. Sooner or later the device will find a confirmed real</span> <span class="calibre2">identical dimension. Companies buy this identical dimension point at auction, which goes for</span> <span class="calibre2">billions of dollars. So the phone spits out an insane number of tiny codes, looking for this</span> <span class="calibre2">confirmed IDP. Trying to find one of those where your friend might be is like finding a certain</span> <span class="calibre2">rock at the bottom of the ocean. Burnt toast I would say.”</span></p>
<p id="page_49" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You lost me way before the random toast part. Is the phone lightly toasted where it’s boring? Or</span> <span class="calibre2">burnt toast that sticks to the top of your mouth when you eat it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It’s sticking to the top of your mouth, but do you want the toast or not?” She said. “Because you</span> <span class="calibre2">can start a shift on it, and you might be able to get back to the dimension your friend is in. But</span> <span class="calibre2">not on that phone's battery. Not an eight-hour shift. Unluckly. I know a solution.” Brooke bit her</span> <span class="calibre2">lip. “It’s going to suck. Hold onto your butts.” Brooke typed something on my phone. “Are you</span> <span class="calibre2">sure you want this? If you do this, Future Treats can’t send anyone to save you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I… I can’t leave her. I promised.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“A weak answer. For what you have to do. But. Sure. I’m going to switch some settings to help</span> <span class="calibre2">you out…. I ask one favor. On the condition that this works, I will present it to you at a later</span> <span class="calibre2">time. Is this acceptable?” She asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Anything.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She shrugged. After doing more typing, she handed the phone back to me. “Deal. It’s gonna</span> <span class="calibre2">suck. The phone only charges halfway. You can’t replace batteries or recharge when you’ve</span> <span class="calibre2">started a shift. I’ve helped your odds by changing some settings and cutting the shift in half, but</span> <span class="calibre2">you’re going to be cutting it close. I would avoid checking your cabbage feed, but don’t tell them</span> <span class="calibre2">I told you. And don’t pay for verification. In my opinion, it’s a scam.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I squeezed the PDA so tight my hands turned white. “I’ll figure something out. Thanks, Brooke.”</span> <span class="calibre2">I said. I walked out of the store and back out onto the busy strip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I sat on the bus listening to a screamo metal band on the cd player, cranked to 10. The bus jostled</span> <span class="calibre2">back and forth as I held onto the handrail. Looking out the window, I saw row after row of stucco</span> <span class="calibre2">housing until finally I saw Mia’s house. At the stop, I jumped off the bus onto the pavement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">After taking a deep breath I looked towards the house. How would I find Mia after I started the</span> <span class="calibre2">shift? A feeling of dread came over it. I didn’t know if I would come back. I didn’t know if I</span> <span class="calibre2">should come back. But I wasn’t going to leave her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Here we go.” I walked closer to the house. I started to press “Start Shift.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">But the door opened. I stood face-to-face with Ms. Kaye.</span></p>
<p id="page_50" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What are you doing here, Rory?” Ms. Kaye looked down at my shirt pocket, which held Mia’s</span> <span class="calibre2">CD case. “Where did you get that?” She asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m going to get her. She’s going to be back real soon. I’ve got this.” My fingers were red as I</span> <span class="calibre2">gripped the phone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Tell me!” She screamed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My shoulders hung. “You wouldn’t believe me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You’re hiding something.” She said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I could hardly speak. “My future self got involved in a stupid time travel scam. We earned a</span> <span class="calibre2">bunch of money. For you. For us. I beat myself over the head with cabbage. But we couldn’t take</span> <span class="calibre2">everything we won. Mia didn’t make it out. But I’m going back to get her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t think you’re well,” she said. Actually, that’s not what she said. I won’t say what she said</span> <span class="calibre2">but you get the idea.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It’s the truth, Ms. Kaye. I messed up, but I can fix it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Tell me the truth!” She made a mad dash towards me, charging at me as if I were a rodeo clown.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I pressed “Start shift.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The PDA sounded up like a roaring dial-up, a noise it hadn’t made before. On the top right of the</span> <span class="calibre2">screen, a battery icon flashed. The picture showed the battery less than half full.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“THIS will be the reset point you will return to!” The device reminded me. Ms. Kaye grabbed</span> <span class="calibre2">my shirt and pulled me towards her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I tried to run but she wouldn’t let me go. The PDA swirled and puttered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I screamed. “Get away from me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Confetti burst out of the device and landed on the ground. The ‘cosmic light show’ Brooke had</span> <span class="calibre2">talked about began. My vision went black. My stomach got sick.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Something grabbed at me. My eyes adjusted as I turned. Ms. Kay and I both drifted towards the</span> <span class="calibre2">dimension. Together.</span></p>
<p id="page_51" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I found myself at the entrance of Mia’s house again. Arriving in the new identical dimension.</span> <span class="calibre2">The doorknob wouldn’t turn, no matter how hard I pushed. I turned to a stunned Ms. Kaye, who</span> <span class="calibre2">stood on the lawn with her jaw dropped. Well, I guess as if she had time traveled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Something began to play through the phone. “THANK YOU for choosing to work for Future</span> <span class="calibre2">Treats! This shift has been sponsored by New Dip Fun Burgers! We changed the recipe and</span> <span class="calibre2">dipped the fun back into our burgers! 2 for 20 bucks but order now and get a 3rd for only 10</span> <span class="calibre2">dollars more! MUST SIGN WAIVER TO EAT FUN DIP BURGER, NO REFUNDS, ALL</span> <span class="calibre2">CRIMES COMMITTED IN AN IDENTICAL PARALLEL UNIVERSE ARE DEEMED</span> <span class="calibre2">IMAGINARY BY LAW IN THE U.S.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know who’s inside the house, but I need your help!” I began pounding on the door.</span> <span class="calibre2">Hoping. I kicked so hard I lost feeling in my bare feet. “Someone!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Aurore!” Ms. Kay cried running to me. “Why did I get teleported a few inches away from</span> <span class="calibre2">where I was?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It’s a new identical dimension. I need one of us to understand what’s going on here Ms. Kaye!</span> <span class="calibre2">We can't both be clueless.” I kept pounding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The door opened. Hand braces rattled. It was Mia. Kind of. This girl wore about seventy million</span> <span class="calibre2">necklaces around her neck as if it were the coolest thing ever. Her long blonde hair hung below</span> <span class="calibre2">her shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Ewww,” she said. “Are you Aurore’s sibling or something?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What year is it?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What year is it?” Ms. Kaye interjected. “It’s 2002, what do you mean what year is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Jr. High Mia looked at me in confusion. Her right hand gripped around strains of hair as if it</span> <span class="calibre2">were a Tamagotchi. She squinted. “Is that you, Mom? Why are you here? You’re supposed to be</span> <span class="calibre2">in Phoenix for two weeks. You look tired.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Thanks.” Ms. Kaye said. “I haven’t had to travel to Phoenix for business since… 1998.” Ms.</span> <span class="calibre2">Kaye started to put the pieces together.</span></p>
<p id="page_52" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Jr. High Mia looked at her older mother confused. “Um… Yeah, you do. You go all the time. You</span> <span class="calibre2">get fired?” Jr. High Mia asked. “Are you taking me to the party?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“1998 was so long ago,” I told Ms. Kaye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why is younger Mia standing in my house?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“There’s only one of me?” The teen tugged at her own hair. “I don’t get it. Why is everyone</span> <span class="calibre2">freaking out?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Sure,” I said, trying not to confuse her. I guess that was a confusing response, but whatever. I</span> <span class="calibre2">walked away from the front door and pulled out the PDA. How did I end up in 1998? It didn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">matter. Maybe she would be in the year this all started. I didn’t know how things worked, and I</span> <span class="calibre2">didn’t care.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I found an order from 2002 and tapped on it to accept it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The device spoke. “Error. 5c23wy0u. Dimensional jump mode enabled. Please authenticate and</span> <span class="calibre2">explain the rules of the shift to your other self before accepting an order.``</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Ms. Kaye gawked. “What have you gotten us into Aurore?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Aurore?” Little Mia asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My lips sucked inward in confusion. “Authenim… authenimate… what am I doing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The device showed a picture of two PDAs held together, with a heart between them.</span> <span class="calibre2">“Authenticate” Which like, gross, right?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t have another PDA,” I cried. “Oh my god, I don’t have another PDA to authenimate</span> <span class="calibre2">with.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Little Mia looked at me with her hands on her hips. “Why did Mom call you Aurore?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Um… Call me… Azami or something, I don’t know. That’ll make it easier.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">There had to be a way to locate another device. There had to be a way to make this crazy</span> <span class="calibre2">situation work. But what was I going to do with Ms. Kaye? I couldn’t get myself and Mia out of</span> <span class="calibre2">the reset point. How was I going to get both of them out? Trying not to think about it, I searched</span> <span class="calibre2">the phone trying to figure out some way to get out of this mess. I found something.</span></p>
<p id="page_53" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Find my phone!” I blurted out loud. Remembering something. “My future self used Find my</span> <span class="calibre2">phone to find us at the stadium. Maybe I can find the dimension Mia is in that way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Little Maria looked at me. “I’m right here? That’s a hella weird thing to say to someone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I ignored her. I heard footsteps behind me. She looked over my shoulder. “Where is my Mia?</span> <span class="calibre2">A-zam-mi?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“PHONE FOUND!” The device said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I screamed. I heeled over and hit my hands on my shins, which by the way I held the PDA in that</span> <span class="calibre2">hand. That hurt, but I stomped my foot on the ground, repeatedly. Ms. Kaye and the youngling</span> <span class="calibre2">backed away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s my address,” I pointed. “It’s my mom’s address. My home. Oh...”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Little Mia’s all like “Can someone tell me what’s going on?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Before I could figure out what to say, a familiar van drove into the driveway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Maria!” The woman yelled from inside the van. She honked the horn and killed the engine. The</span> <span class="calibre2">tall woman who stepped out looked to be in her late twenties, muscular, with dark hair, and wore</span> <span class="calibre2">large round sunglasses. She stopped and turned to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What you looking at?” The famous aunt Bianca glared at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Just enjoying the sunset,” I held my breath. I’m not sure what I meant, there was no sunset.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Audrey?” Bianca asked seeing Ms. Kaye making her way into the house. She stood next to her</span> <span class="calibre2">niece, putting both of her hands on her shoulder. “Why aren’t you in Phoenix? You finally quit?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I need everyone in the house. We need to talk. We have a problem.” Ms. Kaye turned to me.</span> <span class="calibre2">“Aurore, give me the death device you are holding. Turn it off.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I stepped back. “I can’t. That’s the only way I can find Mia.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“More people are going to get hurt.” She begged. “Please. Give me the phone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I panicked.</span></p>
<p id="page_54" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I can’t. I promised you something in another dimension. And I messed up. But I’m going to</span> <span class="calibre2">keep trying until I get it right. Trust me, Ms. Kaye.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I sprinted to the van, started the engine with my keys, and backed out of the driveway. I floored</span> <span class="calibre2">the gas and raced away from the house. Leaving everyone on the lawn behind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">As the hippie van sped down the road, I couldn’t help but wonder. How could I fix this now?</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">When I went inside my own house, I could see my mother lying on the sofa in the living room.</span> <span class="calibre2">She laid in the same spot she had when I left her in 2002. She narrowed her eyes at me. I hadn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">realized how much I looked like my mom. She almost looked like a younger Azami if that makes</span> <span class="calibre2">any sense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Well,” I whispered. “Hi, Mom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She tried to sit up. “Who are you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You should drink some water.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Before going upstairs, I stopped in the kitchen. All the dishes were dirty, and the dishwasher</span> <span class="calibre2">hung open, half-loaded. I cleaned a glass and then filled it with water. I walked over my mom.</span> <span class="calibre2">The big TV playing at full volume. My mom took it, to my surprise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why are you in my house?” She asked, taking a sip of water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m here for Aurore.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Okay,” She drank the rest of the glass of water and put it on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I shook my head in disappointment. “Thanks, Mom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I went up the stairs and into my old room. I cringed at the sight of all the papers on the wall, held</span> <span class="calibre2">up by thumbtacks. They were poems I had written that I thought were amazing. They ended up</span> <span class="calibre2">in the trash a few years later.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">From the corner of my eye, I saw something move. Someone standing on a chair, looking into a</span> <span class="calibre2">mirror I had kept on an old dresser.</span></p>
<p id="page_55" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">No. Freaken. Way. There I stood: fifteen-year-old me. Yawning, with a sweatshirt inside out.</span> <span class="calibre2">Confetti scattered through the floor as the fan spun above.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why are you wearing a sweatshirt?” I asked. “It’s hot out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why are you wearing like no clothes?” Rory asked, stepping down.“Who are you?” They took</span> <span class="calibre2">their headphones off. My, as in ‘Rory’s’, hair, looked awful. They had cut it short, and their</span> <span class="calibre2">bangs stuck up. Like they were conducting weather experiments. Little me looked like I hadn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">washed my face in weeks, which I bet I hadn’t.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The hell you do to your hair!” I yelled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I cut it. I found some photos of someone who looked like me but older on the U-pad and</span> <span class="calibre2">decided to cut it like them.” They said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I had NEVER and would NEVER cut my hair. And oh my god, did I sound like that??</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Doesn’t matter.” I said. “I need whatever thing you got in a package. The one that shot out</span> <span class="calibre2">confetti.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You can’t have my U-pad. It has games on it.” They said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I’m like “There’s games on here? Never mind, I need that phone now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You’re not the boss of me. Get out of my house.” Rory said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I am the boss of you, I am you,”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Ewww. No. Why do you look like that?” They said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Like what? There’s no time for this Rory. You don’t get a choice.” I started looking through the</span> <span class="calibre2">room, through all the garbage I used to collect I used to call my things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Where is the PDA?” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m not giving it to you!” Rory clenched both fists.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I ducked down to look under my bed. Something hit the back of my head. I turned around. There</span> <span class="calibre2">Rory stood, holding a math book above their heads.</span></p>
<p id="page_56" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Kid! The hell?” I yelled. “They charge you a lot for leaving marks on textbooks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m hitting you with something heavier if you don’t leave right now!” Rory yelled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Listen to me. You let me authemniate with you, and I’ll do anything you want. I got a van. We</span> <span class="calibre2">can go anywhere. Do anything.” I took a step back. “Anything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory looked at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">At first, Rory hesitated to get into the van. But after I reminded them of the ice cream, they got in</span> <span class="calibre2">and fastened their seat belts. It kinda sucked. I was that gullible but I always kind of knew.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What should I call you?” Little me asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Azami,” I shrugged. Who cares what they call me? They weren’t going to be there for much</span> <span class="calibre2">longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory looked at me. “I can’t say that name. It’s hard.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It’s not hard. A. Za. Mi.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Okay. A,” Rory peeked out the window and began counting light posts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Cool, kid,” I sighed. Close enough.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Kids ran everywhere at Sweet Scoops. What I thought would be a short stop for ice cream looked</span> <span class="calibre2">like it would take a lot more time. Time I didn’t have. I could sucker the gullible kid into</span> <span class="calibre2">authemiateing a different way. I looked at the PDA battery level and tried not to think about it</span> <span class="calibre2">too much.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Sorry,” I heard the woman say from behind the counter. “We’re closed for a birthday party.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We’ll go somewhere else, kid. Let’s go.” I motioned them back outside.</span></p>
<p id="page_57" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Aurory!” I knew the sugary sweet voice. I turned my head and there she was: freaking Sally</span> <span class="calibre2">Lewis. She sat at a table in her cheerleading uniform. eating a sundae with other kids sitting</span> <span class="calibre2">around a bunch of presents.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">This was the party I didn’t go to three years ago. That little psychopath had tricked me. I</span> <span class="calibre2">remember laying around all day upset that day. But Rory looked happy. This didn’t feel like the</span> <span class="calibre2">same dimension, yet it had to be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A woman stood up from her cake.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Sally reached out with her arms. She smiled wide. “Sit down, Mom. I apologized in the</span> <span class="calibre2">invitation Mia gave them. Aurory, come and have some cake! It’s German chocolate!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I never got an invitation to Sally Lewis's' birthday party. We had a fight over it. Mia never gave</span> <span class="calibre2">me anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I turned to Rory, but Sally had run across the room. She hugged them. Rory didn’t move. Their</span> <span class="calibre2">eyes widened like a cat getting too much affection and not knowing what to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The hell you doing, Sally?” I asked. “You hate me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know you?” She asked, hugging Rory still. She had a smile on half her face and a frown</span> <span class="calibre2">on the other it seemed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Right, look we can go somewhere else,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">‘Please don’t go!” Sally cried. “We’re playing table pool, then having cake, and…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Can you let go of me, please?” Rory wigged their way out of Sally’s death grip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She bounced up and down on her toes and grabbed Rory’s hand. “What kind of ice cream do you</span> <span class="calibre2">want? They got Strawberry Blast-ro-naut! Pieces o’ Cookies n Cream!” She started listing off all</span> <span class="calibre2">the flavors they had at the store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The hell?” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I heard Rory shout from across the store. “Hey! Ass Amy! What kind of ice cream do you</span> <span class="calibre2">want?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Azami.” I winced. “The coconut and chocolate Surprise.”</span></p>
<p id="page_58" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory shot me a look. “Eww.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“They don’t have it!” Sally yelled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“They have it! Second to the bottom left by the… Oh right. 1998, Um. I’ll take whatever Rory</span> <span class="calibre2">has.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Sally waved and pointed to the corner of the ice cream display: “Cookie dough Da-no-delight!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">With all my soul I tried not to say anything. “Thanks, Sally.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I took a seat near one of the mothers in the booth. Rory walked over to me holding two giant ice</span> <span class="calibre2">cream cones with sprinkles. Sally, who didn’t finish her sundae, walked with them, smiling. They</span> <span class="calibre2">came to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m glad we came,” Rory sat next to me. I shifted towards the wall so Sally could join us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You got enough room, Rory?” Sally asked waddling in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I couldn’t hold it any longer. “They threw you up against a tree, Sally. What are you…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Sally shrugged. “That happened last week. I was wrong. I should have left Mia out of our fight.</span> <span class="calibre2">No big. It’s okay to make mistakes.” She took a giant bite of ice cream. “I’m glad you showed</span> <span class="calibre2">up. I didn’t think you’d ever talk to me again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">In the “real world” I had not ever talked to Sally again. I coughed. “Think I need something to</span> <span class="calibre2">drink.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory laughed at my discomfort. My jaw dropped. There I was. Smiling. Not a depressed smile, a</span> <span class="calibre2">real one. Grinning from ear to ear. Joyed to be around people. They started talking about some</span> <span class="calibre2">kids' new trapper keeper. A feeling came over me that I didn’t know how to describe as I</span> <span class="calibre2">watched them interact, like a normal kid. Eating ice cream and telling silly stories about floppy</span> <span class="calibre2">disk drives failing with their homework lost on it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Can you stop looking at me?” Rory finally asked me, with a disgusted look. “It’s creeping me</span> <span class="calibre2">out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I ignored myself and thought about how that me wouldn't get to experience life after the shift.</span> <span class="calibre2">There was no way to bring Mia back without winning the job. I had to kill that younger version</span> <span class="calibre2">of myself. That’s a thought that turned my stomach. I had already made my choice. There was no</span> <span class="calibre2">going back now.</span></p>
<p id="page_59" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I pushed my younger self out of the booth, intending to go find something to drink to take the</span> <span class="calibre2">pain away. But Sally scooted back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Bianca stood at the end of the table, smiling at me. Not a good smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Stay there a moment. Tell me about your van.” Aunt Bianca stood, crossed armed with the</span> <span class="calibre2">family wild bear eyes. Little Mia “Maria” stood next to her. “Tell me about the sunset.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Where’s my invitation, Maria?” Rory asked little Maria. Which was not a cool thing to do in</span> <span class="calibre2">front of Bianca.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I gave it to you. At lunch on Friday.” Maria looked down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You didn't!” Rory shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What would you know!” Maria shoved Rory.</span></p>
