<p id="page_60" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Episode 6 The Reset</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Leaning in towards the booth, Aunt Bianca chewed gum, holding Maria back. Sally gently stood</span> <span class="calibre2">in front of Rory, who tried swinging after the water fountain bully.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Want to talk about your little joy ride with my van, sunset?” Biacana said to me with the the</span> <span class="calibre2">palms of her hands lying flat on the table. “You wake up and decide it’s a nice sunny day for</span> <span class="calibre2">grand theft auto?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Mom wants us all back at the house. To figure this out,” Maria said, holding the side of her</span> <span class="calibre2">bloody nose.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s my van,” I stated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Bianca's lips jerked out. She started to yell “Ex-Fu…” Bianca stopped and looked at Sally who</span> <span class="calibre2">smiled, looking happy to be there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She chose nicer words: “What did you say?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I turned around, looking out the window behind me. There in the parking lot sat the van. I</span> <span class="calibre2">noticed something else: a tiny crack on the lower part of the window above my head. I looked</span> <span class="calibre2">back and saw Rory holding their PDA. I moved my pocket computer thing as close to theirs as I</span> <span class="calibre2">could.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Authenticated! Data transferred! Future Treats assets secure!” It said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Data transferred? I hoped nothing on the rammy chip got moved and I had a chance to track the</span> <span class="calibre2">real Mia still.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Turn your pager off. We got some talking to do.” Bianca spoke to me as if I were some lawyer’s</span> <span class="calibre2">personal assistant.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I grabbed Rory’s cell phone with my left hand and ripped it out. My right hand jabbed into the</span> <span class="calibre2">glass, PDA side up. I totally was going to break the window.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s not how that works.’ Bianca laughed at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I shoved the table towards Bianca as hard as I could. Rory and Sally scooted away from me. The</span> <span class="calibre2">mothers at the table nearby stood up.</span></p>
<p id="page_61" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Bianca rushed at me. I climbed my way up on the table bench and jumped over my past Jr. high</span> <span class="calibre2">self. I spirited out of sweet scoops, holding on to the items in my hands with dear life. I made for</span> <span class="calibre2">the exit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I took the keys out of my shirt pocket with my right hand and opened the door. The keys turned</span> <span class="calibre2">smooth in the ignition and the engine started. With the van in reverse, I stomped on the gas and</span> <span class="calibre2">turned as hard left as I could. I shifted into drive and floored it once again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">As I grabbed the steering wheel with my right hand, I noticed I held something. The wrong PDA,</span> <span class="calibre2">Rory’s PDA. I stopped the van and leaped out. I ran back towards my own device.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Bianca, Maria, Rory, and Sally, along with most of the rest of the party, ran out of the building.</span> <span class="calibre2">Bianca ran to the exit and stood in the middle of the road. Rory held my old time travel machine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t want to do this,” I said. I ran as fast as I could to the dimension death device, but I</span> <span class="calibre2">looked up. My eyes locked with Biancas, who made a mad dash for the van. I couldn’t make it,</span> <span class="calibre2">and I did not want to get in a fistfight with that woman. I turned back and ran to the van, shutting</span> <span class="calibre2">the door and raced out of the parking lot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I drove down the road. Screaming and cursing at the steering wheel. “Why couldn’t you have</span> <span class="calibre2">held onto it?!” I yelled at myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I took a breath. The smell of the van clogged up my nose a little, but I kept trying. I looked at the</span> <span class="calibre2">phone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The edge of the Rory’s phone had cracked. As I tried not to not freak out with a full on panic</span> <span class="calibre2">attack. I had to turn back into my lane before I hitting a curb.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“One hour until the end of the shift!” The death device buzzed. I glanced again and saw a</span> <span class="calibre2">message written on the screen. This shift is a 4-hour shift, due to Future Treat minor worker</span> <span class="calibre2">labor practices.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Brook?!” I yelled. My hand hit the steering wheel. I guess she did tell me this would suck. This</span> <span class="calibre2">wasn’t what I wanted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The phone went on. “Aurore’s voice recognized. Would you like to load your profile and your</span> <span class="calibre2">last known RAM image?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“YES!” I shouted. Then I remembered what the Future Treats employee said. If the rammy chip</span> <span class="calibre2">had to be unloaded it was over. Burnt toast. “No!” I corrected it.</span></p>
<p id="page_62" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Ram profile loaded.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">You ever had a moment when you lost all control of your senses and feelings? I had one of those</span> <span class="calibre2">moments on the freeway. I had to devalue myself to escape, and I never was going to see Mia</span> <span class="calibre2">again either. I couldn’t even feel the wheel in my hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The van tires hit the curb as I pulled over to park near a quiet side street. I rammed my head into</span> <span class="calibre2">the steering wheel and screamed into the void.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Brook changed the settings on my shift so that I would have 4 hours to save Mia. And I couldn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">do it. I was screwed. My only chance was to somehow beat my younger self and to go back, to</span> <span class="calibre2">take on another shift.</span> <span class="calibre2"><i class="calibre8">But how?</i></span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The duffel bag!” I shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I backed into the ridiculous cabbage store and turned off the engine. The timer on the phone</span> <span class="calibre2">dwindled to minutes remaining on the shift.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Inside, Brook stood where she had last time, reading the handbook.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You know, you could get the money first,” She chuckled. “Your older you never figured that</span> <span class="calibre2">out. Your shift ends soon. Better get that bag, so our plan will work.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“How could you know?” I asked. I speed walked towards the back of the store. “Why are you</span> <span class="calibre2">always here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m always working,” She deadpanned. “Living large.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I went to the room the bag had once been in before. In a different identical dimension that is.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Oh,” Brook remembered. “Your younger self is here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The fluorescent lights in the back room were so bright they hurt my eyes. My younger self stood</span> <span class="calibre2">in front of me. Holding the Future Treats duffel bag of money.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Please,” Rory begged. “Don’t tell me you also thought of taking the bag and hiding it so you</span> <span class="calibre2">had more time to figure out what to do.”</span></p>
<p id="page_63" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah, Kid,” I lied. “That’s pretty smart. How did you learn about this? About what is going</span> <span class="calibre2">on?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I talked to Ms. Kaye,” Rory pulled on the bag around their shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“How would she know anything?” I asked. “She wasn’t with us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why didn’t you tell me one of us is going to die?” Rory backed away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The box of money. I had left the money with Ms. Kaye when I returned from the other shift. She</span> <span class="calibre2">must have gone looking for Elon’s cabbage. But why was Sally here?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m trying to do what’s best for everyone. Those choices are hard,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You suck at making them,” Rory jeered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I know. You’re supposed to keep messing everything up until you get everything right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You’re not getting this money.” Sally handed Rory a cabbage.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Something happened. At first, it felt like I had been hit in the back head with a wet pillow. I</span> <span class="calibre2">rubbed my neck where I felt chunks of cabbage. I turned around.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I had the right to be hurt, but instead I sighed. I turned around to face Ms. Kaye. Holding a head</span> <span class="calibre2">of cabbage over her. I closed my eyes, “Hey Ms. Kaye.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She lowered the cabbage. “Hey, Aurore. Or Azammi. Whatever.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m trying so hard to do the right thing. I’m trying to get her back. I wish you’d help me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You’re in it for yourself. Brook told us everything. You can’t do this. Not like this.” She said,</span> <span class="calibre2">hurt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory could see the pained expression on my face. “I’m not in this for myself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I leaped towards Rory, who now made a mad dash with Sally towards the back exit. Rory had</span> <span class="calibre2">almost made it out , but the bag snagged on the door frame. They tried to clear the frame but it</span> <span class="calibre2">wouldn't let go. I grabbed the bag and pulled.</span></p>
<p id="page_64" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The phone DINGED. “Shift over! Get to the Reset Point!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Sally grabbed onto Rory, and then onto the bag. They pulled together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why is Sally here?” I yelled. I felt another soft hit to the back of my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Can you stop hitting me with Cabbage, Ms. Kaye?” I yelled. “You’re making a mistake.” I</span> <span class="calibre2">pulled. The bag broke free.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Before I could plant my back foot to run, Rory bear tackled me, knocking me back. I reached to</span> <span class="calibre2">push them off of me, but they pushed my hands away, causing me to lose my grip on the bag.</span> <span class="calibre2">BUT I GRABBED MY PHONE BACK!</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">On the floor, I rolled as hard as I could away. Years of stop, drop, and roll in elementary school</span> <span class="calibre2">had finally paid off. My elbows banged on the floor, leaving my skin raw and burning. I didn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">care. I pulled out the phone and found an order as fast as I could. I backed away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A message appeared on the screen. “Ram transferred. Travel to dimension 07827534?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I hit confirm so hard my finger jammed. It was over, but I might as well cling to hope. That was</span> <span class="calibre2">my thinking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The phone spoke in a different, calming voice. “Confirmed, Rory! Traveling to dimension</span> <span class="calibre2">07827534!” It said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory dashed at me, but I backed away in time for the phone to take me away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I fell hard to the ground, blinking. The store looked more modern than it had in the other</span> <span class="calibre2">dimension.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I heard a voice from the other room. “Got both the phones uh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You bet!” I yelled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Nice,” Brooke crooned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Welcome to 2002! Special code successful! A similar dimension that matched your request has</span> <span class="calibre2">been loaded.

<p id="page_65" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I didn’t know if Mia was safe, or where she was. I had no way of knowing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I gasped. “Find my phone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Now you’re getting this.” Brooke encouraged, not looking up from her desk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre1"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I had to take a bus to get to Mia’s house. But since I had both phones, no one would get out of</span> <span class="calibre2">any universe. Finally arriving back at the Kaye house I yelled and made whatever noise I could,</span> <span class="calibre2">hoping someone would come to the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The door opened. There was that curly side part and an instant eye roll. She wore an oversized</span> <span class="calibre2">t-shirt with a pocket, no pants, and no shoes. As if she had just arrived.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Aurore?” She spoke softly in that wonderful sarcastic voice crying. “I am so happy to see you.</span> <span class="calibre2">How did you get here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know how to tell you.” I said. “The cabbage lady got me here. Mia. You’re right. I need</span> <span class="calibre2">to stop beating myself up. Because at the end of the day, I’m all I have, and I’m no good if I’m</span> <span class="calibre2">all black and blue. I can do things. Like finding a way to see you again. I can live without you.</span> <span class="calibre2">But I don’t want to. I’m going to hug you. If you’ll let me,” I told her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I was wrong,” She said, crossing her arms. “Back at the reset point. I shouldn’t have pushed you</span> <span class="calibre2">like that.” She shifted, leaning against the frame. She looked to the side. “ You punched a hole in</span> <span class="calibre2">my wall and are about to kill an entire universe's worth of people. But I don’t want to live</span> <span class="calibre2">without you either.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I tackle-hugged her so hard. I held my face close to hers, holding onto her with my everything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I want to learn how to function. With you.” I said. “I lost you. It’s hard to explain but I lost</span> <span class="calibre2">myself too. And now I’m here and we are going to have to act now. Together.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What’s wrong?” She asked, concerned.</span></p>
<p id="page_66" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know how this is going to end.” I almost whispered, holding down the trauma. “The next</span> <span class="calibre2">choice we make is going to be hard. Like Brooke said. But we need to go. And you got to trust</span> <span class="calibre2">me. For once. Not to slam the door. Or drop the phone. And we have to tie up your mother.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What?” She asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You also lied to me about Sally Lewis’s birthday party. She totally did invite me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“No she totally didn’t,” She looked down and away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’ll explain at some other time. Our time. We need to get to the reset point to take back the</span> <span class="calibre2">duffel bag so we can escape.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Steal back the duffel bag? From whom? Your future you? Why are we tying up my mom?” Mia</span> <span class="calibre2">walked alongside me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It’s okay, she hit me with cabbage. Everyone is trying to do the right thing here.” I canceled my</span> <span class="calibre2">order in 2002, taking another one in 1998, back in the other universe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Hug me,” I leaned in for approval. She did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I hit confirm. The phone took us back for one last shot at getting things back to normal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Welcome to 1998! This dimensional jump has been sponsored by Jim Bob shaving cream! Jim</span> <span class="calibre2">Bob shaving cream gives you a close shave every time. About. Now comes in three distinct</span> <span class="calibre2">edible flavors! Raspberry, Lemon, and extra whipped. Try some on your favorite dessert!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The phone buzzed. “Shift over! Please return to the reset point to return home with your</span> <span class="calibre2">winnings!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We heard a thump from upstairs. Like someone walking across the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s from my room,” Mia said loudly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We ran upstairs. The locked room was not a Mia thing. I thought I heard voices and faint</span> <span class="calibre2">whispers of breathing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“They didn’t leave the bag here, did they?” I asked.</span></p>
<p id="page_67" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Mia!” Ms. Kaye yelled from the other side of the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Get the bag!” I yelled, charging inside. Mia went after her Jr. High self. I held my hands to my</span> <span class="calibre2">pockets to protect the phones. Rory and Ms. Kaye charged at me. Sally stood in the corner,</span> <span class="calibre2">watching.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I realized what was happening. I ducked. Bianca swung a baseball bat. She swung at my knees,</span> <span class="calibre2">missing as I pushed my hips back away. Rory threw a head of cabbage, wacking me in the face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Got it!” Mia yelled. She ran for the exit behind Bianca. She swung the bat downwards, missing</span> <span class="calibre2">Mia probably on purpose. I dashed by Rory and pulled Ms. Kaye to the other side of the door. I</span> <span class="calibre2">slammed it shut as hard as I could using all my weight. I pulled out the phone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A message appeared on the screen: “Weight limit increased. Please return company property.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I heard my younger self cry out. It got quiet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“No!” Ms. Kaye reached for the knob.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Mom! Don’t!” Mia shouted. Ms. Kaye pulled on the door against us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Mom!” Maria pounded on the wood from the other side. “Let me out!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I heard my own voice. “Please! Please don’t do this, Azami. I don’t deserve this. Please! Why do</span> <span class="calibre2">you get to live and I don’t?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m sorry kid. It’s the job. Only one of us can get out. It sucks, but I’ve got to go.” I pressed</span> <span class="calibre2">harder door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“If we are going to do this, we need to do this now.” Mia said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Let them out!” Ms. Kaye pleaded with me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“There’s no other way, We need the three of us to get out of here. That’s the only way we can</span> <span class="calibre2">return things to normal. There are countless dimensions out there, there’s other uses. None of</span> <span class="calibre2">them will feel pain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“But I will!” Rory screamed.</span></p>
<p id="page_68" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I paused. Maria and Bianca kept pounding, kicking at the wood, trying to move us out of the way</span> <span class="calibre2">to escape. I pulled up the other phone. The other phone had the same message.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My eyes closed. I thought about the last time I saw my older self. The look on their face. There I</span> <span class="calibre2">was. Taking everything out on myself again. Hoping by doing it things would get better. Again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Have you ever had a moment you realized you had to do something hard? I had that moment.</span> <span class="calibre2">And I decided to face it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Enough.’ I stood. Mia stumbled up, baffled. I walked away and threw down my phone. The</span> <span class="calibre2">door opened. “Okay little one.” I let Rory walked to me. “If you have a better plan. I’ll go with</span> <span class="calibre2">it. I don’t need to fix all my mistakes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The duffle bag issued an audible warning. “Reset and return the company property now. Or face</span> <span class="calibre2">the consequences.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The young ones should get out.” Biacna said. “Older one’s stay behind.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia grabbed my hand and squeezed. We nodded. Rory, Maria and Sally stood together by the</span> <span class="calibre2">bed. Maria had the money bag.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We stood back towards the corner of the room near the ‘screaming labrums’ band posters,</span> <span class="calibre2">huddling together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory’s finger hovered over the screen. They looked at Sally and Maria.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The duffle bag buzzed. An alarm sounded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Get going. Go make a bunch of mistakes.’ I waved.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The three stood in what felt like a photo. Not moving. Not blinking. Not breathing. The noise in</span> <span class="calibre2">the bag grew louder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Go on Rory.” Ms. Kaye said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory and Maria looked to each other.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Maria sighed. “Don’t do it.” She said. “They’re dumb.”</span></p>
<p id="page_69" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I know. Mia!” Rory snapped. They threw the phone. “You adults act like you’re all smart. I</span> <span class="calibre2">think secretly none of you have a clue what you are doing. How is this going to solve anything?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“RETURN COMPANY PROPERTY NOW!” The bag roared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Rory, you’re going in.” I put the phone back in their hand. “You’re resetting.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We heard a voice from the other room. “Hello! I’ve let myself in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Brook appeared from the hallway, wearing a tie and black slacks. She put one hand in one pocket</span> <span class="calibre2">and put the other hand on her hip. We found ourselves backing further into Mia’s room. Bianca</span> <span class="calibre2">picked up the baseball bat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You’re in the wrong house.” Bianca patted the metal with her palm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Nonsense. I’m here for my favor.” Brooke said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory gasped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“This is an uncharted dimension. No one can find us here,” Brooke said. “So I want… wait. Why</span> <span class="calibre2">is everyone standing around the phone and the duffel bag? You weren’t. You weren’t going to</span> <span class="calibre2">reset were you? The realization hit in and you realized you didn't’ have to end the world? I hinted</span> <span class="calibre2">pretty hard, I said we had a plan. Are all the phones on airplane mode so we can let the batteries</span> <span class="calibre2">drain out?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We all looked at each other. Rory and little Mia shook their heads at us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah that’s what we did.” I lied, putting the phone into airplane mode. “1998 is cool. We can</span> <span class="calibre2">hang out here.” We breathed out collectively a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Most employees don’t figure out the whole Future Treats scam falls apart if you don’t do</span> <span class="calibre2">anything.” Brooke said. “No offense. But it took you a long time to figure that out. Anyways. I</span> <span class="calibre2">take some money from the bag and a few USB drives as part of the favor. The thing will run out</span> <span class="calibre2">of power after 48 hours. I’d put it in a noise proof room until then. I’ll have to hang out for a</span> <span class="calibre2">while, since I have nowhere to go. With that in mind, where is the bathroom?”</span> <span class="calibre2">Sally pointed brooke towards the bathroom while Biacna helped find whatever she could to</span> <span class="calibre2">silence the bag.</span></p>
<p id="page_70" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I realized Brooke didn’t tell me about the plan because the phone was recording us in a chartered</span> <span class="calibre2">dimension. Now it didn’t matter. She could have said something later, though I’m not how her</span> <span class="calibre2">shift worked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I faced my youngerself. “I’m going to learn to be cooler to you. I’m not beating you up anymore,</span> <span class="calibre2">from here on out I am your friend. We might not get along, but I promise I will fight for you. I</span> <span class="calibre2">don’t know how. But I’ll learn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory paused. “I don't know how to respond to that.” They whispered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I want a sonnet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“No.” Rory nodded their head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“So no one is dying?” Bianca asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia tackle-hugged her, and then me. She buried her face in my cheek. I squeezed her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I woke up like I did most mornings when living at the Kaye’s house. Though I wasn’t wearing</span> <span class="calibre2">my emotional support hoodie I’d never be able to replace. Well, I could if I went to the same</span> <span class="calibre2">store and bought the same hoodie in the same year but it wouldn’t be the same. Though I felt off,</span> <span class="calibre2">I felt that since I accidentally killed everyone in an entire universe I shouldn’t complain. I’m not</span> <span class="calibre2">proud of everything I’ve done. If I had better information at the time I would have acted</span> <span class="calibre2">differently. That’s how hindsight works, I’m learning. Sometimes our mistakes hurt others. But</span> <span class="calibre2">we didn’t kill everyone in this one, so I’ll keep doing the best I can.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I made my way downstairs super early and made a full pot of coffee to start off the new routine.</span> <span class="calibre2">Rory sat at the counter, already up with their suitcases packed. Their hair stuck up worse than</span> <span class="calibre2">normal, but they didn’t seem to care.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You can make coffee, you know,” I reminded them. That wasn’t always a thing when the other</span> <span class="calibre2">me lived at home. I have no idea if young me should be drinking coffee either, but that didn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">stop me at that age so I let it be. But our mom had started getting better after she took a part-time</span> <span class="calibre2">shift at FuKuYu family market. Dr. Tanaka opened a few years early after we told her what</span> <span class="calibre2">happened. Rory lives with me, but we tried to go visit when mom wants to see us. We're all</span> <span class="calibre2">getting there.</span></p>
<p id="page_71" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The coffee pot clanked. I poured Rory a cup.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m putting milk in mine,” Rory said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s fine,” I sighed. They poured milk into their cup and began to drain the entire sugar</span> <span class="calibre2">container. I got annoyed, watching them use all the sugar in the house. Sure, we have more</span> <span class="calibre2">money than we know what to do with. But we’re figuring out our ‘laundry’ arrangement with the</span> <span class="calibre2">store. So we can pay taxes and spend our money. I didn’t want to go buy more sugar. I wanted to</span> <span class="calibre2">say something about being wasteful. But then I saw how my younger self smiled. In the morning.</span> <span class="calibre2">I didn’t shake my head. I left it alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia entered the room. Rory opened the fridge door to put back the milk. They turned to the</span> <span class="calibre2">waking bear. They tried to gently close the door. But it fell out of their hands and slammed shut.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m s…” Rory began to mumble.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Thank you for trying.” An annoyed Mia said. Little Maria walked down the stairs, with an equal</span> <span class="calibre2">hate of existence. She sat next to her older self.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I poured another cup and handed it to Mia. She sat in silence, eyes squinted, hair ruffled for a</span> <span class="calibre2">couple of minutes. She continuously checked her cup with her hand. When the coffee had</span> <span class="calibre2">cooled, she took a sip. She turned to me and smiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Sally will be here soon. Her parents are dropping her off for the trip. I need to talk to Ms. Kaye</span> <span class="calibre2">we go.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I poured one last cup of coffee. I messed up Mia’s hair with my free hand and headed upstairs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Knocking on the bedroom door, coffee mug in hand, Ms. Kay said. “Come in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I brought the coffee mug in and sat it the nightstand. She stood in front of the dresser, packing a</span> <span class="calibre2">suitcase for our trip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You said you wanted to talk to me last night, Ms. Kaye?” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah. I’m finishing up packing. I’m going to try to call Bianca before she takes off to meet us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Nervous about driving? Or meeting your past self for the first time? My first time didn’t go well</span> <span class="calibre2">for me.”</span></p>
<p id="page_72" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yup.” She zipped up a large suitcase. “And New York is far. But she. I. She needed time to</span> <span class="calibre2">think.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We have time,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Can you. Talk to. Myself for me? And tell her everything that happened? Because. I’m not sure</span> <span class="calibre2">I put it into words okay. Our first phone call did not go well. We fought over the house.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I can try.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She looked back up. “Are you worried? Is the company going to come after you? For not</span> <span class="calibre2">returning the duffel bag with the money?” Ms. Kaye asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“After the death devices powered off, Mia and I buried them. They can’t find us here. ” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The doorbell rang.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That must be Sally.” Ms. Kaye frowned. I laughed at this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We both headed to the living room. Sally’s parents, and Brooek from the cabbage store, helped</span> <span class="calibre2">bring in two large suitcases. I walked behind Mia and rested my head on hers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“How long are we going to stay at the park??” Sally asked, all excited.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Rory was like, “As long as we want.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Dips on the front seat,” Brooke stuck up her finger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I put my hand on Mia’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I told you things were going to get better,” I said. I decided to eat breakfast while everyone got</span> <span class="calibre2">ready. I took one of the home baked cupcakes from a container on the counter and took a bite.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia stole a bite from the other side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">And that’s how I finally learned to live with myself. Not that it’s easy. Rory and I can’t agree on</span> <span class="calibre2">anything but I guess that’s how things go. Mia and Maria pretend the other doesn't exist. I bet</span> <span class="calibre2">it’ll get easier for them.</span></p>
<p id="page_73" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Meeting yourself for the first time is strange. And you might find yourself saying things you</span> <span class="calibre2">don’t mean. Rory won’t stop saying “I’d never do that.” It’s confusing but we’ll make it. And so</span> <span class="calibre2">will you two. Just take it easy on yourself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Oh. Had you thought about what you wanted to call yourself, ‘other’ Ms. Kaye?</span></p>

<p class="calibre12"><span class="calibre11">Episode 1</span></p>
<p class="calibre7">Sakura Tomodachi had spent the morning by the river, filling a silo with buckets of river water. The other villagers had worked for weeks on an irrigation system to help with the recent drought but had run into problems with some of the local wildlife. So they elected the poor Saku to fill up the wooden water bin while the others kept the area safe.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’m tired of this. Curse the conquerors.” Saku said to herself. Her hands were cold from the river but her face was warm from a heat not expected in a coastal village. She looked to the top of the foothill at the container, relieved that the work was almost complete. By the next day all the water would be gone, sent off in bamboo tubes to the thirsty green tea plants on the slopes below. Then she’d start out the next morning, refilling the bin. Until told otherwise, that would be her life.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“If you think you are tired now, I have bad news.” A voice came from behind Saku. A woman approached, wearing a dark cloak complete with a quiver of arrows and a long black stained bow that hung on her shoulders. She squinted into the sun at the water silo. “And be thankful the conquerors took over, and stopped us from eating those crazy blossoms. Can you imagine if we all still wandered around talking to those dead things all the time?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Easy for you to say, Mibu.” Saku pressed and cooled her forehead with her still cold hands. “You haven’t had to carry water up the mountain all morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu shook her head. “No, I haven’t. I’ve been on duty on the outskirts. Defending the village. Actually doing something that was asked of us.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku’s muscles ached as she lifted the bucket and walked back up the hill. “<i class="calibre13">I am doing something</i>. I told you I’ve been taking water up, like they asked of me yesterday.” She shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You did, I could see you from my post, filling the wrong silo.” Mibu ’s upper lip rose for an instant but flattened.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They said fill up the west water silo by evening!” Saku cried.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They did.” Mibu crossed her arms. “And now the east water silo is filled and ready when the next season's tea crops. But the west silo is unfilled.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You’re joking Mibu. That way is west. You’re having fun with me.” Saku pointed at the silo. “Wait. No. The sun is in the wrong place. I filled up the wrong one, didn't I?”</p>
<p id="page_76" class="calibre7">Mibu pointed.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You need to hurry.” She said, playfully.</p>
<p class="calibre7"><i class="calibre13">Whack</i>. Cold water splashed on her bare feet. Having been too deep in thought, Saku discovered she had unknowingly dumped all the water from inside the bucket onto the thirsty ground. She cursed.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu bent over laughing. “You didn’t think once to check to make sure you were going to the right one? Oh Saku.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She tried to calculate how long it would take to fill the silo, counting on her fingers as if that would give her an answer. It did not.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I don’t believe in thinking.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu uncrossed her arms. “Come on. Let’s get this filled.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I thought you were on duty?” Saku asked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu grabbed an empty bucket and dipped it into the waters. She gave Saku a look that made her feel uneasy. “I was until I saw you headed up the wrong side of the mountain. I’m here to do your job. Again.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Of course.” Her eyes wandered in the direction of their village, Fukui. “Why can’t I do anything right?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu placed a hand on her shoulder. “I’m used to you disappointing me. It is my curse. It could be worse. Rusu could have seen you. We are lucky to have one of our own in charge who takes it easy on us. You remember what Yataku’s people used to do to workers who made mistakes? Or. Knew about people like us?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The memories flashed before Saku’s eyes, memories she did not like to dwell on. She also didn’t like being called a curse.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Come on.”Mibu went on. “We need to finish before the gathering tonight, before anyone finds out I left my post. Rusu’s would really be ticked off if she knew that.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Gathering? Why are we having a gathering? Is this about the drought?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Oh Saku.” Mibu said, shaking her head. She sighed before walking past carrying two buckets. “ It’s been talked about for weeks. I know not. But all of Fukui is summoned.”</p>
<p id="page_77" class="calibre7">“You think they’d miss me if I didn’t show up?” Saku refilled the container and ran up the hill to meet her. Something caught her foot, and the next thing Saku knew she had fallen and was feeling wet dirt on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Don’t worry. I will always protect you. You’re the best… sparring partner ever. Though, If you keep spilling water we’re never going to finish. And someone is going to find out.” She said, helping Saku to her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I will make it up to you. Someday. Somehow.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">–</p>
<p class="calibre7">After completing the task, which with the help of Mibu was much quicker, they made their way to the temple in the middle of the village. Some others still dressed in their working clothes came out of their longhouses, the roofs covered with dying grass. The two noticed that the people had already gathered. Rusu looked at both of them walking in late. Her eyes narrowed at them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They didn’t say what this was about?” Saku asked Mibu, looking into one of the longhouses. In the middle was a garden with a shriveled tree. People used to grow their own food in the old days, keeping their own crops. But lately no one had been able to grow much. It’s hard to grow crops in dust.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Do they ever tell us anything, Saku? Why is Rusu looking at us?” Mibu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They tell us to work faster, and not to have feelings.” Saku sneered.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Other than that. I think we are in trouble.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">They passed the dry pond under the giant arch, joining the others near one of the older shrines. After they had taken their place, Rusu nodded at them. She then addressed the crowd next to a cherry tree, whose blossoms looked withered.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“This morning came word from Shao Song. They informed me they have increased their tea and rice tax. And have doubled their tribute demand. We will need to quicken our pace if we wish to meet this. We need to minimize our mistakes, like making sure we deliver things to the correct place.” Rusu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku heard a few laughs. Mibu’s eyes widened. Others began to bicker aloud. Saku raised her voice. “Double? The amount of tea they want is ridiculous! Don’t they drink anything else?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu gave a friendly but firm jab to Saku’s ribs. “Stop speaking, we are in danger.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Rusu’s eyes caught Saku’s. “Your attachment to Mibu seems. Unnatural.”</p>
<p id="page_78" class="calibre7">“Our business is our own.” Saku said, feeling the villagers' eyes turned upon them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You’re still talking.” Mibu said, hitting Saku a second time in the ribs. “You’re going to get both of us…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“The conquerors have requested a shipment of the forbidden tea be brought to the city as soon as possible. Lord Yataku is hosting a grand meeting to calm relations with other lords in the land. As you know, the others who have been sent on this task. Did not return. I feel like this is a good job for you, Mibu.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku’s hand caught Mibu’s as she tried to hit her again for speaking. Saku threw her hand aside.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No! I will go!” Saku said, stepping forward.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Laughter erupted. Some people clapped. Saku stood, looking into Mibu’s light brown eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Let me go with her.” Mibu said, turning in a panic back towards the speaker. “Let me guard her to ensure that…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No.” Rusu said. “Maybe that is one job Saku can do correctly. You are to depart tomorrow after the sixth morning bell.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Please! She doesn’t know what she’s doing, I will go!” Mibu shouted. But all of the villagers left, leaving the two behind alone. She kicked at the dirt ground. “We need to get out of here. Tonight.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No.” Saku said. “You know what happens to those who try to leave. The conquerors find them, everytime. I must travel to Shao Song, alone. This is the only way our village will ever accept us for who we are. Maybe others will start seeing how unfair living like this is.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It doesn’t matter if this is fair, Saku. This is just the way it has to be. If we want to keep living. And speaking out only makes it worse.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We’re supposed to do what then? Working harder, and keep living on less and less?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We have to do what we need to do to keep on going. That is the only choice. That is why we should leave. If anything ever happened to you I’d never be able to forgive myself…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Weren’t we meant for more, Mibu?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We’re meant to grow the conqueror's tea. That is all.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Then I will prove to you, that you are meant for more.”</p>
<p id="page_79" class="calibre7">Mibu hung her head. “Stay safe. And when in doubt, don’t say anything. Please. Come back.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’ll be back.” Saku said. “I’ll show everyone. I’ll even bring you back something from the markets you always tell me about.” She smiled. But Mibu did not.</p>
<p class="calibre7">***</p>
<p class="calibre7">The next morning, six bells rang echoing throughout the dusty hills. Saku gathered the rest of her meager rice rations and returned to the temple. To her surprise no one greeted her in the small closed off structure. The rowhouse was usually guarded but not that morning. She entered, seeing a large grass woven pack overstuffed with what she assumed was the forbidden tea. However, this kind Saku had not seen before. Most of the villagers had not seen this before. Only special handlers were allowed to prepare the flower petals in that location using ingredients sent from Shao Song.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She knew she should have made some travel rice balls the night before for the day long journey. But after carrying water all day her back and forearms throbbed with soreness. She hadn’t felt like cooking. Rice is also used as money, and she knew if she wanted to buy anything in the markets she would have to eat light. At least she would not have to carry water for the next few days, being able to stop along the rivers along the way.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The bag was so heavy and overfilled Saku buckled at the knees when placing it on her back.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s a lot of tea.” She found herself chuckling at the insane amount of rich scented petals. So much that none of them were even allowed to drink. She thought about what she had heard about her people in the past, and about how the conquerors had banned the flowers that turned them mad. The villagers were known to carry skulls around all day. They weren’t allowed to talk about those times anymore, not out in the open at least. It felt strange to her that suddenly she was allowed to not only carry it, but deliver it. She wondered why. The conquerors could drink it without anything happening. Why would they be offering it to other nations?</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku looked around the Temple before setting out. The entire village was still covered in thick dust. She pulled at her jacket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I better get going.” She thought. But then she paused, and looked about. She had no idea which direction Shao Song was in, especially with the dust.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I guess I’ll figure it out.” She said. After a few hours the dust be lifted, and she would see the western mountains and would be able to find the city from there.</p>
<p class="calibre7">So she set out, not knowing where she was going. Saku had seen Mibu once head to Shao Song on the road outside the temple, so she picked that way and began to walk, hoping she headed in the right direction.</p>
<p id="page_80" class="calibre7">–</p>
<p class="calibre7">The dust did not lift after six hours of walking. Though Saku was confident she was still heading in the right direction, for the road still lay under her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Her stomach growled. She knew she would need to stop and prepare something soon, but Shao Song must have been only a few hours away. But she looked down to what she thought was the road, but saw only dirt ground.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What happened to the road?” She said, stomping her feet. She could see nothing but the dust. “Well. I’m doomed. That didn’t take long.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Suddenly, Saku heard a voice behind her. “What are you looking for, stranger?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She quickly turned, and saw a man standing behind her. The dust seemingly lifted around him.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’m looking for the village of Shao Song.” She answered. She noticed the man was wearing an outfit that she also had, a dress of a very bright orange color. He had a crazy haircut that looked funny to Saku. “I thought this way would take me there.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You’re almost to Shao Song.” The man replied. Saku recognized his dialect to be one of the conquerors. “If you follow me I can take you there. It’s down the road from here. We could be there within the next few hours. All I ask is for a little cooked meal.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’m starving.” She said, “If you help me find water I’ll prepare onigiri. Then you’ll take me the rest of the way?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’ll take you the rest of the way.” The stranger agreed, grinning. “What’s that on your back?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Tea.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The man took a few steps towards her and smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You are one of those skull people that they keep finding dead, aren’t you?” He said. “I like you.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku began to follow him, having been taught to obey all conquerors orders, but stopped. She looked and asked. “What is your name?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The man turned around and smiled. He held onto the handle of a large katana. “Just call me Ayashi.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">–</p>
<p id="page_81" class="calibre7">Nearby, she could hear the sounds of a stream. From beneath the dust, a massive tent appeared in front of them. The front and the back of the tent allowed air in and a large side flap allowed entrance. It looked to Saku as if the man lived there. Ayashi took off his katana and placed it inside. She wandered looking at the stream before turning to the firepit in the middle of the encampment.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s a nice sword.” Saku said, pointing at the katana laying now in the tent. “I need one of those if I’m going to be traveling, uh?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Ayashi smirked. “You can’t have this one. I claimed it recently. It is so new that I haven’t even tested it out yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku wasn’t listening, she was rummaging in her pack. “You have a pot to cook rice in? I seem to have forgotten my cookware.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">After a few moments Ayashi brought a large pot with a heavy lid, along with a pan. He lit the fire and placed an iron grid over the stone pit.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Get cooking.” He said. “And cook some of these.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">He handed her four large eggs. “What are these?” Saku asked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Duck.” he said. He pointed to a spot near the stream. Their feathers lay, along with the corpse of a bird. It’s bare skull seemed to be looking at Saku. She turned away.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’ll get everything started.” She began to cook. As she did, Ayashi put a kettle filled with river water on the fire.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The rice turned out wet and mushy. Saku prepared the soggy onigiri anyways with the burnt egg inside. Ayashi handed her a black cup made from clay. The liquid inside was so dark she could not see to the bottom.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Drink this.” He said , trying to swallow the food she had prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What is it?” Saku didn’t look before drinking. She had drunk all of it before Ayashi spit the onigiri to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Let’s call it Sake.” He said, taking another bite. “Wow. That was easy. Now, before we leave I want you to help me test out my katana.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What do I need to do?” Saku sat the empty cup down and leapt to her feet. She stumbled. She felt her eyes grow warm, and her mind began to wander. Before she realized it, she could only focus on the sound of a laughing man.</p>
<p id="page_82" class="calibre7">“You don’t need to do anything.” He said. It looked like he was walking towards the tent.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What did you do to me?” Saku asked, trying to get control of herself, but Ayashi did not answer. He prepared his weapon for it to be tested.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku tried to regain her footing. Inside her mind thoughts violently began to swirl. Images of her people appeared, but not like some of the old paintings she had once seen that the conquers had destroyed , but real people telling her many things. As hard as she tried she could not grasp what they were saying.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Run!” A voice inside her mind cried. Other voices joined. “Run!!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She realized she couldn't tell what was real anymore. The lines had seemingly blurred after drinking whatever she had drank. She suddenly heard another voice, but this one seemed more real.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They’re telling you to run stupid.” It said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku’s eyes darted in the direction of the voice. It seemed to be coming from the skull of the duck.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Don’t call me an idiot!” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You don’t have time to argue!” The skull said, “Run!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku ran towards the stream.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Not that way!” The skull cried.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She turned around, but there stood Ayashi with the katana raised.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Let’s see how sharp this is.” He told her. He swung down towards her. She rolled out of the way, barely missing the blade.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Ayashi charged at her again, but she was able to move out of the way. She had no idea what was going on. Laying on the ground, surrounded by chunks of bones, the skull said. “I’m not sure why I’m having to tell you this so much, but run!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She kicked the man’s leg. He dropped the sword. She rolled by the skull, grabbed it, and ran as fast as she could into the forest, without the tea.</p>
<p class="calibre7">***</p>
<p id="page_83" class="calibre7">“Can you get your hands off my eye holes? I can’t see.” Said the skull in the palm of Saku’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She dropped it on the forest ground and took a step back, reaching out to take hold of a dark red barked tree covered in moss. Her hands covered her mouth. Partly in shock, and a little because of the fog of dust that still lingered.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I don’t like it down here. Pick me up.” The duck skull said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What are you?” Saku bent down, keeping her distance. Voices cried out, from where she did not know. They seemed to be speaking in her mind. She fought to drown out the multitude of voices.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What does it look like I am?” Said the skull. “I’m a duck. And I’m dead. I thought that was easy to follow.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She placed the palms of both hands on her head and dug her fingers through her hair into her scalp. “I must be crazy.” She stood to her feet, before taking a few steps away and shouted “How are you talking?!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“...That’s like asking how are you breathing. Everything dead talks, your people listen and everything is kept in balance. Which, by the way, y’all have done a horrible job with that the past 100 years or so.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We help you out? What are you talking about? That man tricked me!?” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“The ex-Samurai you were cooking for, like you were married?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That man was a Samurai?” Saku dropped down on her knees to address the talking deceased thing. “The one who wanted to cut me in half all of a sudden?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No, the other one. Duh. Ex masterless Samurai. Ronin. That’s what those crazy people do, go around trying to cut people in half for fun. I think after you’ve killed a couple of hundred people in battle your moral compass goes straight out the window. Along with your sense of fashion.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku blushed. “I have that same dress.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The skull didn’t reply for a moment. “I said what I said. Why are you acting like this is new to you? You’ve drank that tea before haven’t you? You had your 18th year tea celebration or whatever you do?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We’re not allowed to drink the tea. We haven’t been allowed to for a very long time. It makes us talk to… Wait. That’s why I’m talking to you now isn’t it? You’re responding only in my head.”</p>
<p id="page_84" class="calibre7">She dropped the skull on a mossy rock, which bounced before landing in a bush.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Uh? No, I’m really talking to you. Come one, you skullies know this. That’s what my mother always told me. You take care of the wild and keep everything in balance. We quack a lot. Everyone does their part and all that. No one told you about this agreement? What do you all do all day now?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Work? Growing tea? Tea that I need to get back from Ayashi and deliver to the city. Before they do something to Mibu.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The skull looked at Saku strangely. “...You’re growing tea? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“How am I supposed to get my bag back from that. Torso chopping happy ex-samuri?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Did a skull person, of the ultimate wild magic arts, seriously just ask me how they can defeat an ex-samuri? You ask that like you don’t know you can command undead armies and summon lightning from the sky.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku blinked. She picked the creature back up again. “I’m sorry. What do you think my people can do again?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Are you really a skull person? You don’t sound like it.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Skull. Attack that tree.” Saku pointed at the skinniest weakest tree her eyes could see.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Skull person. No.” It said. “My name is Kamo by the way.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She held Kamo in her hands, checking its eye holes. “See Kamo? I can’t command undead armies or shoot lightning from my eyes. I’m a normal person.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Of course you can’t shoot lightning out of your eyes, that would be silly. I said you can shoot lightning from the sky.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku turned Kamo back in the direction of Ayashi’s camp. “If I don’t get that tea delivered, I don’t know what the conquerors are going to do. To me or my village.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">If Kamo could have roll his eyes he would have. “Maybe one of them in your village can call on the wild for aid? Someone who knows what they are doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Maybe this craziness will wear off. And soon I’ll just be holding a dead duck skull, feeling silly yet gross about myself. I’m going to leave you here. And go wash my hands.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Dudes gonna drink your tea if you don’t go do something.” Kamo said. “And you need my help. Don’t leave me down here, I can’t walk, I have no legs, Saku”</p>
<p id="page_85" class="calibre7">She sighed. “I can’t. You aren’t real.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I am very real. Take me along and let me prove it to you. When the tea doesn’t wear off, and you realize the things you can do, you are going to want me. And if I stop talking? Then you can leave me.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She thought of what everyone would think if somehow someone back in the village knew what had happened. Memories of other people from Fukui not coming back, or even worse the times the conquers had made strung up the bodies of those who were unable to do their duties as assigned came to her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I don’t have a choice.” She said. “I’m going to prove I can do things without Mibu. I will take you with me. For now. Until I find someone who can cure of this. Tea illness or whatever is going on right now. I’ll find a way to fight Ayashi long enough to grab the bag. All without letting the people in the castle know where I am.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She carried Kamo in her arms towards the camp.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You didn’t even bring a weapon?” He said. Saku didn’t reply. “Yikes. Better grab a stick or something.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She held the skull close to her face and narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’ll drop you.”</p>
