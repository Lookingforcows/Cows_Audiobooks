<p class="calibre7">For hours Jiro’s men battled to retake the Misemono. The north and their allies retreated to the outskirts of town. At the suggestion of “Lord Tomadachi”, the warriors were sent out to key points in the city until the morning. Fushichou suggested the carnival as a resting place due to its tactical advantage. Saku wasn’t sure what this meant, but it seemed like a good plan. It was her idea for the willing samurai and entertainers to patrol the streets. Until the armies could be repelled.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Outside is a strange choice to sleep,” Oni-chan said. “Are you sure you don’t want a better dwelling? You are the daimyo now.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan the lantern, with his own face on it, high so that Mibu could finish placing her bedroll. The giant had placed them in a tent not far from the stage. He realized Saku was looking at the animal hide of the tent, with a look of disgust.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It is only for the night.” Oni-chan told Saku. “Few hours.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Did it have to be animal?” Saku asked. Oni-chan shrugged.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Really?” Mibu scuffed. “If you wanted you could order twenty geisha’s and a persimmon, and you’re upset that the tent is normal? “We’ve slept in an animal tent before. You didn’t care then.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">They tried to situate themselves in the space as best they could, but the overwhelming feeling of responsibility lingered in Saku’s mind. Giving out orders had been more exchusing than summoning lighting, and the looks from Mibu’s face while doing it tired her more.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Things are different now.” Saku said, still looking at the hide disapprovingly. “Now that I know this was an animal with a story to tell, I can’t look at it the same way anymore. But the tent will do for now.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No more skull talk.” Mibu said. “You will sleep it off. The city might be fooled, but I’m not. And when they realize it we might be in trouble when the conquerors figure out...”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They are not our conquerors anymore.” Saku walked to Mibu and gave Oni-chan a look. He got the idea.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We wake early to meet the north at the temple on the edge of the city. Rest well.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan nodded at Mibu and returned to his dwelling for the evening. The air had warmed once again and the cicadas chirped. Saku looked down, with her fists clenched as Mibu rummaged through her pack for rations. She found onigiri and handed it to Saku, who took a bite as soon as she could. The salty plum and rice was satisfying, after losing so much strength throughout the past days. Mibu pivoted towards her, and bit into her own ration.</p>
<p id="page_129" class="calibre7">“This is not of craziness.” Saku said after taking a last bite. “This is a gift. A gift we have been lied to about all of our lives.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What are you suggesting? “ Mibu said. “That we were once a village of. What? Tea drinkers? Who really could talk to skulls? And what, the Shao Song took this from us? But let us keep growing the tea for some reason? And no one has bothered to try it, until you Saku? Why would any rational nation do this? I know you can be stupid, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I am not stupid. They wanted to suppress our power.” Saku said. “Have you ever thought about our schooling growing up? It's like they wanted to confuse us, and punish us if we did not listen without resistance. So that we follow their rules without question. They take us away from our parents early on to stomp out the last embers of our past. We are a threat to them. But no more.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Hearing that, Mibu laid on her bed roll. Her hands rested behind her head as she looked up. She closed her eyes and sighed deeply. “I can’t begin to explain how disappointed I am in you. We had a lot of good teachers who worked really hard with us. I never thought you would do this. What you speak is not truth, it is sickness and it is despicable.” Mibu reached under her bedroll and picked up a small rock. She flung the rock into the night.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Why don’t you believe me? You’ve always believed me.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu rolled to her side. “This isn’t believable. That is why. We must rest.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“LISTEN TO…” She stopped and covered her mouth with her hands. Mibu jolted up in panic and looked to her. She stood there. Silent for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I can’t get mad. I want to show you. But I don’t want to hurt you.” Saku said. She sat down next to her on the bedroll.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Why is your hair standing up like that?” Mibu asked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It is because of my powers.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Powers? Really Saku? Thinking you can talk to things is a power?” Mibu rolled back over to face the wall of the tent. “Bet you haven’t washed it since you set off for the trip. That’s why.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku turned to the bag she had been given with the skull flowers inside. She wanted to look at them, but did not want to start a fight.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Saku.” Kamo said. “I’m not sure what to do about your friend there, but if you put me somewhere I can see I can scream at you until you wake up. That way you get up early.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Really?” Saku whispered.</p>
<p id="page_130" class="calibre7">“What?” Mibu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Nothing.” She took Kamo out of her pocket and placed him so that he could see outside.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu rolled over to see what Saku was doing. She frowned. “Can we put the gross toys away please?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Kamo is my friend.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I am too tired.” Mibu said. “Come back to me. The real you. The one who understands the value of hard work and loyalty. If you continue on like this, I won’t be helping you. Our village will not either. Daimyo, or not.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku said nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Now hold my hand.” Mibu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She did. Her eyes did not close for a long while. She wondered to herself how she could prove her truth. But her eyes grew heavy, and soon she drifted into sleep. –</p>
<p class="calibre7">“WAKE UP!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku rose at the sound of the screaming skull. A sharp blistering thump rang out. At first Saku thought it was the wind, but realized an arrow had struck the tent tool. It’s shaft was painted blue.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Mibu!” Saku shook her friend and looked back out. Mibu sat up. She grabbed the bag and her weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I heard commotion in the distance.” Kamo said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu grabbed the long bow and searched the area. On the edge of the misemono lights flicker. The sky gently began to light with dark blue light. The morning sun would soon make an appearance. They could hear the cries of men and swords clashing. She reached for an arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She took a step forward and signaled Saku to be silent as she choked down her emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“She’s listening to screaming.” Fushichou said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We must go help them.” Saku said, beginning to walk in that direction.</p>
<p id="page_131" class="calibre7">“If that is the clans, we can not fight them by ourselves. Even if you think you have powers, there’s too many of them. We need to get out of here.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We can’t leave Oni-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“There’s nothing we can…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku ran towards the sound of the clanking.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“ Stop!” Mibu cried to her.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She didn’t listen. She hurried towards the misemono entrance, holding her katana high. Mibu ran after her with her weapon drawn.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan and other performers struggled to keep a large bamboo gate closed. Others and their families scattered into a chaotic collecting of belongings. Cries rang out from the other side. Saku put the sword back in it’s sheath, and ran to help.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Wait.” Oni-chan shouted. “You need to get out of here. Noriko is going to want you dead.” His massive forearms strained against the efforts of the outsider invaders.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I won't leave you. We aren’t finished here. We need you...” Saku said, stepping up.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Dozens of sharp twangs ripped out from above. Arrows flew over the wall. Saku turned and saw Mibu leap in the field behind her, missing an arrow narrowly.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Get out of here. ” He said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu cried out. “We need to tell others before the entire city falls. We can get the word out at the castle.” Mibu said, readying her bow looking at the gate. Saku’s eyes drew to where the cracking sound was coming from. With a snap, the gate broke in two.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Thank you for your kindness.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku met Mibu and dashed towards the back of the fenced property. A wave of men lunged across of what remained of the gate. Entertainers, a “yokai” and a ‘kappa’, or so they claimed to be, fought with crude stage weapons against the north's strongly crafted katana’s.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan dug in his heels but could hold the men back no farther. Dirt spread upward from where he landed. A balding man in a blue kimono with his hair pulled back stood over him. The Tomodachi samurai fought back around Oni-chan, trying to get to his position.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan tried to get to his feet, but it was too late. Saku could only watch from afar as the northern samurai jabbed the dagger into him.</p>
<p id="page_132" class="calibre7">***</p>
<p class="calibre7">The two women found themselves running through smokey streets heading towards the castle. Saku breathed in sharp through her nose, and smelt a bitter and grassy burn.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“The flowers!” Saku shouted to Mibu. She pointed towards the smoke. She quickened her pace towards the skull flower fields.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Can you stop running into danger!” Mibu passed the stone entrance and joined Saku in the fields, who was cutting every flower she could. Mibu turned towards the castle. There also were flames.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Hanna.” Saku said, also noticing.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We can’t save everyone.” Mibu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“This is our last hope.” Saku picked a skull flower and put it in her bag. The bag overflowed.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We can’t…” Mibu began to say. But instead she watched as her friend obsessively placed flowers in the mermaid bag. Mibu stood. Horrified. “The field is on fire! Saku.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Yes! Hurry! Take all you can carry.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Enough of this! No More Saku! You’re going to get us hurt!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku began to stuff flowers in Mibu’s pockets. “Just believe me.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Believe me!” Mibu shouted. “You are sick!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Then be sick with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu saw smoke quickly rising ahead of them. She took a flower and snapped it at the stem. She took another. “Now let’s go!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The smoke followed them until they arrived on the edge of the district. Saku stood on the street, looking back to the burning field. Flames roared high. The chatter of panic and chaos echoed throughout the city. Men ran carrying weapons, running towards the castle.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What if these are the only flowers left?” Saku thought. Slowly realizing. “If they are attacking Shao Song. They will send men to Fukui. We need to go find Ayashi and get to our village.”</p>
<p id="page_133" class="calibre7">They fled towards the castle at a hurried pace towards the city. They found a royal messenger and sent word to Jiro to hold the city until they returned. They escaped out into the forest, heading towards the village.</p>
<p class="calibre7">–</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku and Mibu crept up to Ayashi’s encampment. They had traveled along the river there in hopes that he had returned to it. But instead, a lone man in blue sat on the stump where Saku had once drunk the tea. He drew no sword. He nodded at the woman, and motioned for them to sit down. They hesitated. The man showed them the palm of both hands. “I am Lord Noriko. Lord Tomodachi. I am here to talk.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The two skull women stood. With their arms crossed. Lord Noriko shrugged but did not seem concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Where is Ayashi?” Saku spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Place your weapons on the ground. You have my word you will not be harmed.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku looked to Mibu. She spoke. “You attacked the city after inviting us to a peace treaty. We can not trust you.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I did not attack.” Lord Noriko said. “The forces of the city attacked us. Lead by Jiro. Ayashi. And Hanna. They choose not to counsel you, but to try to kill us in our sleep.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No.” Saku said. “They wouldn’t do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“This isn’t the first time the two have done this before Saku. This is merely the echoes of a deal poorly drafted. I have paid the cost of their mistakes today. I knew you would come here. Looking for Ayashi believing he was helping you. He was helping himself.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You lie.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It might be unwise to lie to one who can summon thunder.” Lord Noriko said. “I only speak truth.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku put her weapons down. Mibu did the same, but reluctantly.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You were a creation of Ayashi.” said Lord Noriko. “You were given the tea so that you would aid his cause. So that he would have an unstoppable weapon. You happened on the way, so he chose you. My spy believes this. You have caused many people harm.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“My only intention is to do what is right.” Saku said.</p>
<p id="page_134" class="calibre7">“I believe you.” Lord Noriko said, sitting up. “I would have requested to speak to you in person if they had come to surrender as I requested. But now it does not matter. The city of Shao Song is mine. Ayashi and Hanna shall be dealt with, with care. I am here to speak to you about your village.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Why me?” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I do not recognize Rusu as head of the village. For I did not appoint them, they can not be trusted. For she was placed by Lord Yataku. That part of the world is gone. You were trying to take what originally was my daimyo of your village, a proper council with us in the coming months. I shall give the city time to regain it’s own order. We do not seek control of your people. But we do request that the tea trade is kept open only to us. I give to you my letter to read to your people stating these wishes.” He handed Saku a letter sealed in red wax.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s it?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“There is one matter you should consider wisely. You and the village must destroy all the remaining skull flowers. I shall not take them from you. But you should consider your power. And what a people might do with it who have been sickened by lies.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You’re talking about the crazy tea too?” Mibu said. “Is this a joke?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Is that why you burned the flowers?” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Yes.” Lord Niroko said. “Because I had to. What if there are others out there who get powers from this? Your village is no longer the keepers of the wild like they once were. Maybe not all of your village should that power.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You’re telling me.” Mibu spoke. “If we trade with you, you will leave us alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Yes.” He said. “If you destroy every last remaining flower. We will happily trade with you. But If you do not, we shall destroy you. We shall give you time to decide. We shall seek you when the time is right. Do I have your understanding? And your promise to council with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Yes.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I shall see you both again soon enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">At that he stood and bowed. They bowed back. He walked into the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Why does he believe you can summon lighting?” Mibu said. “He’s going to learn that’s a lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It’s not a lie. But the things he told us? Just now? Those were lies. We have to get to the village as soon as we can. Our people are in danger.”</p>
<p id="page_135" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Episode Seven</span></p>
<p class="calibre7">Off in the distance, waves crashed onto the Fukui shoreline. Saku and Mibu stood staring, collecting their thoughts after the day-long journey from Shao Song. The gray skies cast a shadow upon the village. Saku breathed in the salty air. The rich scent of dry cedar and pine loomed, and this calmed her spirit. The vegetation around the village somehow looked drier than it had before she left. Neither of them could remember a time where the land looked like it did. The green tea crops on the hill sides were brown and leaned heavy to the side. This was a sign that the water silo had failed to keep their crops alive.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Our people are not ready for this.” Mibu said, fidgeting with her bow string.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Nor am I.” Saku bent down to rest her knees. “But we have to convince them that the northern clan means to kill everyone. We can’t let them suffer the same fate as Oni-chan. The forces will be here soon. We have to do what we can to stop people from getting hurt.” Her gaze turned to the village, which now looked so small and unimportant.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You don’t think he will keep his word?” Mibu said. “If we destroy the flower, you don’t think he will leave us alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We should have left the village. You should never have gone to the city.” Mibu said. She cursed.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She took a few steps away from hillside and turned back in the direction Shao Song. Smoke still rose. As much as they both might have wished this, that they should have just left, they knew that was no longer an option.</p>
<p class="calibre7">They reached for each other's hand and dead tall grass waved back and forth a passing breeze. Saku smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“This skull talk has put everyone in danger. A friend of yours died because of it. If it does not end, then I can’t keep doing this with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Please.” Saku said. “Don’t do this. Not now.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We have to at least try to meet Lord Niroko’s offer.’ Mibu said. “The flowers should be destroyed. Please. This is bigger than us, if there is a chance we can live in peace, we have to…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“There is no chance.” Saku said. “These clans thirst for power and will lie, cheat and steal to get it. We saw it. All we need to do is find a way to show it to them. But I need you on my side. You are my hope. If these flowers are lost, so is our lives.”</p>
<p id="page_136" class="calibre7">Mibu’s shoulders stiffened, which could be felt in Saku’s grip.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What you have become,” Mibu said, “Is that which has been taught by everyone we have ever known to be wrong. Deplorable. And a hindrance to our peoples progress.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“And those all,” Saku said. “Were lies.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu let go of her hand. Saku hunched her shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre7">***</p>
<p class="calibre7">Rusu shook her head, along with most of the rest of the village standing in the open air at the Temple. “They put the village idiot in charge.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku’s eyes turned away from her back to her people who looked confused. Some scratched their heads, others placed their hands on their hips in disbelief.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s some way to speak to their new leader.” Kamo said from inside Saku’s pocket. “I’m hearing a lot of mumbing, are they usually like this? I’m glad you didn’t return to get hope when we first met.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We must destroy the flowers. This is easy.” Rusu said, trying to raise her voice. Saku held out a hand and shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You have no power here anymore.” She said as loud as she could, addressing everyone who had gathered. “I am your daimyo. And the chosen leader of Shao Song. We must join with them to defeat the north and their allies. They no longer are our conquerors.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">An older man in the crowd squinted and rubbed his neck. “Should we check with someone first? This doesn't seem right..”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu told them what she had witnessed, the people at the castle crying out “Long live Tomadachi.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Well.” The same man said. “Which Tomadachi do they mean then? A lot of us share that family name.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It is I.” Saku said in frustration. “I am your leader. And I am telling you they are on their way, and they mean to kill us all. We need everyone ready to fight as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">People gasped. “That kind of talk is going to scare the children! Besides, we can’t put together an army without the conquerors approval” The old man said.</p>
<p id="page_137" class="calibre7">“No,” Saku said, fighting down her anger. She fought to keep her fists relaxed. “I. Tell what the conquerors what to do now.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Maybe so.” Rusu said. “You might have fooled them, but you do not fool us. If you truly want to do what is best for us, you will at least listen to what we have to say! And I say give them the flowers!” Some people cheered in agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“The Tamina clan of the north, and the Henashi of the northwest, only want to take control of the tea market. I have heard these words from my own ears, as a shinobi died cursing our people. They think somehow this will bring prosperity to the land. They then attacked Shao Song after agreeing to peace talks. The Tamina can not be trusted.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Excuse me.” The same old man said, raising his hand. “The conquerors said tea trade wasn’t a big deal. This doesn’t make any sense. It sounds like you want an excuse to run things.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Fushichou made a baffled noise from the pocket. “They are serious? Whoever controls the tea practically controls the country. Especially if they open up trade routes to worlds far north!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku found herself chucking at this. She covered her mouth with her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Whom do you speak with?” Rusu said. She moved closer. “You look as if you are laughing at something in your pockets.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu stepped in front of Saku. “That matters not.” She said. “What matters is the choice we make next.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Rusu crossed to Saku and looked down in pure spite. “There was nothing in you to ever value. There still is not. Again. I ask. Whom were you speaking with?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku began to pull something out of her pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Don’t.” Mibu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They must know.” Saku reached deeper.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu grabbed Saku’s hands from in her pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You’re hand in my pocket. In front of everyone.” Saku whispered. “In a temple.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I know.” Mibu sighed, with her back to everyone. “I’m trying to protect you from yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I need to tell my truth.” Saku said. “To protect you. To protect everyone. I don’t need your understanding. I need you to listen.”</p>
<p id="page_138" class="calibre7">Mibu narrowed her brow and slowly, thoughtfully, removed her hand from Saku’s pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku presented the duck skull to the villagers. People gasped. Someone in the crowd shrieked. She then presented to them the owl-eagle skull in the other.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“This is Kamo.” She raised her left hand, “and Fushichou!” She raised her right.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The crowd was flabbergasted for a long while.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I was forced to drink the tea against my will.” Saku could hear the shifting and the uneasiness in the crowd. “But I since then, I can talk to the spirits within these bones. These are my friends. The powers are real. That is why is Lord Yataku has fallen. Because of me. And it can be yours. If you restore tradition, and drink the tea.” She looked into the eyes of the people, and then put the skulls back in her pockets. “I can summon light if I get angry. I didn’t know that when it happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">A disgusted cry rang out from the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Followed by Silence.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The same old man cried out. “We aren’t really going to listen to this nut case are we?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">A man rushed into the garden center of the temple. He turned to Rusu and reported, out of breath “A ship has arrived on the shore! The clan of the north is sending forces this way. We have spotted them in the forest. What do we do Rusu!?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Rusu is not in charge.” Saku said. “I am.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The man stared at Saku blankly. “Is that a joke? Forces that could easily wipe out everyone in this village are approaching, and you're making a joke?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“She jokes not.” An old well known woman by the named Asta spoke. “She is Saku, the daimyo of Shao song, and Fukui.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The man looked at Saku. “I’m not bowing to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No one asked you to do that, Kenji.” Saku said. “Someone please. Drink the tea.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Destroy the flowers.” Rusu said. “And trade our useless tea to the north. From what’s left of it that isn’t brown. If you can talk to skulls and summon lightning, prove it. Show us.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Asta nodded. “Seems fair to me. You are asking us to drink poison.”</p>
<p id="page_139" class="calibre7">“I can’t summon it. I mean. I can. But I can’t control it. And I will not do anything to harm any of you. You aren’t going to believe that the skulls talk no matter what I do.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s convenient.” Someone yelled.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Ask Kamo a question, I will tell you his reply.” Saku said, again pulling Kamo out of her pocket. People gawked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s not going to work.” Mibu said, shaking her head. “Let us decide for ourselves.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku took a step forward and raised her chin to speak. “These flowers are all that remain of the true us. The people we used to be. The people we still are. We can re-learn our past and tell our ancestors stories once again. We have been lied to our whole lives. Our people were not crazy. They were protectors of the wild. Our people have sworn an oath to the soil. It is time that we remember.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">A young boy shook his head. He looked to his mother. “That’s the crazy tea talking.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I speak the truth!” Saku said. She backed off and looked to the sky. She drew in a deep breath. She let it out.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu felt something static surge in the air. She looked around, trying to figure out where the feeling had come from.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Without proof.” Asta spoke, “destroying the flowers is the sensible thing to do. If they kill us after, there is not much we can do.“Our past or not, the conquerors have helped us grow beyond those years. Those are people of the past. Not who we are now.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I shall not destroy my flowers.” Saku held the bag closer to herself. Asta noticed this. “I will not destroy our history.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That was our history.” Asta said. “This is ours now.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Mibu.” Saku said. “Tell them. This is not the best for them. This is allowing the outside world to win. We must allow the past to teach us.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Saku.” Mibu said, biting her lip. “I. Don’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku looked away from her. “I know. I said I didn’t need your understanding. It is not fair for me to ask this of you. Is there no one who will drink this tea? Mibu. You? Please.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu stepped back and hung her head.</p>
<p id="page_140" class="calibre7">No one spoke. Saku slowly backed away from the people. “Decide for yourself. I appoint Asta to manage this affair. Talk it over. Fast. And tell me what you decide. I then will consider your wishes. But I can see now. You do not understand. I’ll fight them myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She turned and walked towards the shore as the shadow of a large sail cast over the village. On top of the wooden boat on the top deck sat a large castle. The northern clans banners waved from all sides of the ship. Archers stood on raised platforms around the castle, holding their arrows high yelling.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu called out. “Wait!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku stopped. She turned around and touched her katana with her finger tips. Her face flushed of all colors. “Do not follow me. If you do not believe me.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu did not move.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I tried.” Saku said. Dust kicked up behind her as she turned to leave the Temple. With the crowd looking on as she walked away towards the warship.</p>
<p class="calibre7">***</p>
<p class="calibre7">Forces holding yari’s stood at attention on the soft coastal sand as Saku approached, alone. She fought the softness as she walked, struggling to get her feet moving the closer she moved in. Until she arrived at where tidepools and waves had moistened the sand. That was enough for her to take a strong stand to face the clan of the north. She adjusted the misemono bag of skull flowers around her shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I have no advice on how to handle this fight alone.” Fushichou said. “This is far out of the scope of my knowledge.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I am not alone.” Saku said. Looking at the weapons the men held. “Not with you two.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Really Fushichou?” Kamo said. “You don’t know what she’s going to do? With all that water around the boat and all?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Okay everyone,” Saku said to her pockets. “I’m off to go die here, so if you can both quiet it down that would be great.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You’re not going to die. Not if you keep calm, spread your wings and… oh yeah. You’re not a duck. Sorry.” Kamo said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I get what you’re getting at.” Saku said. Smiling.</p>
<p id="page_141" class="calibre7">“Greetings. Lord Tomodachi.” An older Samurai spoke. “I am Yoshio. An aid to Lord Noriko. You indeed were given time, though perhaps not the time you might have assumed. Will your village meet our demands?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Yes.” A voice said. Rusu approached carrying a sack with two skull flowers poking out. “Here they are. We agree to your terms. That is what we have decided.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu stood in the field nearby with others.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’m so sorry Saku.” She said. Ashamed.</p>
<p class="calibre7">People of the village drew closer. Asta and Rusu were among them. They both approached Saku. She jolted back away from them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You can not ask this of me.” Saku said, looking into the eyes of her people. They seemed like strangers now. People she no longer could communicate with. They would never believe her. They were going to destroy everything without even trying to understand anything.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Are the last of the skull flowers in your bag?” Asta spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Yes.” Saku said. Facing her.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Hand them to Mibu.” Asta ordered.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You don’t understand what you are doing!” Saku shouted.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu again felt static in the air. Everyone did. People shifted and looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Someone take them.” Rusu shouted. She nodded to a group of men holding crud weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu ran to stand in front of the men. “No.” she said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The men tried to push aside Mibu but she stood firm.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“If you do not give them to us, we have orders to attack. Make your choice.” Yoshio said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“There’s other solutions to this. This can’t be the only way.” Mibu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“If you take a step forward” Saku said to the clan of the north. “ I will be forced to kill you.” She held the palm of her hand on her sword. “Turn back now and leave.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">A samurai reached for Saku’s bag.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Shield your eyes.” Saku shouted.</p>
<p id="page_142" class="calibre7">Her fist clenched hard, she gritted her teeth. She began to scream, but instead channeled that energy to her veins. The man leapt away from her, feeling the power in the air. Without making a sound, she looked to the gray sky. A lightning bolt spilt through the clouds and struck the warship’s main castle. It burst into flames.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Told you.” Kamo said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Samurai leaped over board, frightened. They joined the other forces on the shore, who began to move towards Saku. The surrounded her. She defended herself, blocking the men’s attacks. But the more that attack, the harder it became. With all her strength she fought as the people from her village looked on. Mibu ran, but was out of reach to aid her.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Please!” She yelled. “Stop this! Don’t make me do this!” They did not.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Another bolt cracked above them, striking many men. Other forces kept moving. Saku backed away, summoning another bolt on one of the raised platforms hitting an archer before they could release an arrow. Flames on the ship grew. Men broke ranks, and started running away from the village. Some of the people of Fukui ran to take cover. Mibu rushed to Saku’s side, releasing a shot that struck the last archer standing in flames.</p>
<p class="calibre7">A samurai was in reach and took a jab at Saku. She blocked. With a blink of her eye, electricity came from the sky and was absorbed into the attacker's sword. The man instantly fell to the ground, lifeless. At the sight of this, the northern clan fled. Running, scattered through out the beach. Saku’s eyes followed this, but her heart sank at the sight of northern forces gathering on top of a hill from the other side of the village.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I can’t handle all of them.” She said, seeing the pure number of samurai forces. She turned to the people hiding in the field. “For those who wish me to lead you. Head to the eastern water silo.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu ran with her towards the mountain slopes at the edge of the town. As did most everyone else. Rusu included.</p>
<p class="calibre7">***</p>
<p class="calibre7">The villagers stood atop of the steep slope next to the water tower. They looked down to the northern clans forces who walked up towards the town.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Release the water!” Saku cried. The villagers rushed to the structure and began to open gates on the aqueduct, sending water gushing down the bamboo and onto the soil below. The northern clan stopped, many of the men looking to their soaked feet. They looked back up in time to hear Saku summoning thunder nearby.</p>
<p id="page_143" class="calibre7">“Stay back!” She shouted to the warriors. Most began to retreat, but a brave few made their way up through the tea plants towards the top. She rushed down to meet them. With a swift motion struck a man’s knee with the handle of the katana. He tumbled down.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Last chance!” She screamed. “Leave now or else!” Again, the men did not stop and marched upward.</p>
<p class="calibre7">With a blink she summoned lighting to the slope, dropping a multitude of men who had stood in the wet soil.</p>
<p class="calibre7">But when Saku had called forth the thunderclap, some of the sparks had flown onto the misemono bag, causing the flower petals to go up in flames. The bag burned. She threw it off and tossed it down.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“NO!” She cried towards the bag. Thunder struck the bag, ripping it apart. Saku screamed again. A scream that echoed in the air, which had suddenly smelled moist. A bright flash came right in front of Saku. A sudden crack rang out so loud that it sent everyone, friend and foe, to their knees.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Everyone could feel tingling in their bodies. She found the bag on the ground. In flames.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“NOOOOOOO!” Saku let out a death curdling scream directed in front of her. She began to hit the ground. Thunder clapped. People sheided their eyes from all the flashing light.</p>
<p class="calibre7">And then, for the first time in a long time, it began to rain. Giant raindrops fell to the ground. The thirsty soil quickly drank up as the rain grew heavier. The northern clan fled, back in the direction of Shao Song.</p>
<p class="calibre7">One man, worn from battle and years, called out to the village, spitting angry. “We shall not forget this. This only gets worse from here!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku kept looking at the ashes that used to be the bag. Her hair and garments were soaking wet. She cried. A stream of rain fall down the hill.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu walked to Saku and put a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“All is not lost.” She said. “Trust me. I’m sorry I struggled to believe you. Also, please don’t ever get mad at me.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They're gone.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Trust me.” Mibu said. “Can you get up?” She held Saku to her feet. They walked together back up to the village. The rain continued to fall.</p>
<p id="page_144" class="calibre7">***</p>
<p class="calibre7">The villagers returned to their homes, not sure if to celebrate or if to mourn. All except Saku and Asta. They stood back in the Temple garden, looking over the tea shack where Saku had once loaded the tea to take to the conquerors. Rain beat hard against the longhouse roofs in the most wonderfully deafening way to those who had lived in drought for so long.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Asta spoke, leaning on a fence that overlooked the pond, now filling with water. “The north might not have been completely wrong in their demands. Does anyone in this world need that kind of power? The ability to end life is a force no one should have.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku straightened up. “You learn so much from speaking to the spirits. To fight was not an easy choice. One I made every attempt not to make. But Lord Niroko forced my hand.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku looked up at the dark cloudy sky. She went on. “I had forgotten my favorite part when it rains. Everything is more green. All the plants brightened up, like they had woken up on the right side of the bedroll. I think this. Power is still needed.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Asta nodded. “I am sorry that we did not believe. But it sounded so unbelievable. It went against everything we thought we valued. I ask for forgiveness.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Forgiveness is a means of control. Though I am your leader, I do not wish to control you.” Saku said. “I will rule. I understand that might not be popular with the village. They will learn to accept it. Dissolve the relationship approver consul, the people are free to love whoever is an adult. Dissolve the schools, and teach the children something useful about living. I will need your input, Asta. I wish to listen to the people the best I can. For now I must return with Mibu. Get the forces trained, and ready defenses. Send word to us in Shao Song if trouble comes. By bird if you must. I fear the north will not stay content for long.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I shall do as you wish.” Asta bowed. “But as you said. This is going to be difficult for us. I fear Rusu will lead a resistance at some point no matter what you do. Some are thankful for what you have done. But many feel betrayed by your decision to not do as they wanted..”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“There’s a lot of work to be done, but work on our terms. Someday they will realize I have shown them how special they are.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">******</p>
<p class="calibre7">Mibu heard a knock at the entrance of her home. She pulled back the bamboo sliding door. Saku stood, with a heavy pack and a walking stick. She still had her Katana on her person.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What are you doing?” Mibu said.</p>
<p id="page_145" class="calibre7">“I’m leaving. I’m going to find my friends. To make sure Oni-chan is buried. I came to tell you goodbye.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You’re not leaving without me.” Mibu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You didn’t believe me. How can I be with you? Not after you did what you did.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Come inside.” Mibu pulled Saku inside and shut the door. She walked across a dirt floor to a wooden box. She picked it up and handed it to Saku.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“What’s this?” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Open it.” Mibu said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She slowly pulled the top of the box, making a scraping sound. Her eyes widened. Suddenly she began to cry. Inside were two skull flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You did trust me.” Saku whispered. “But the two flowers that Rusu had…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Were Asta’s. That makes four skull flowers that have survived. I go where you go. Always.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I will find a way to grow new skull flowers. In case any of our people are someday ready. If that is what they choose.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Then let us find a way.” Mibu smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The two left Fukui the next morning. To vibrate plants and fresh morning air. The sun rose, exposing a refreshed and thriving landscape.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Where are we going to find them?” Mibu asked, checking her bow.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I don’t know.” Saku said, peeking in her pockets checking on her skull friends. “All I know. We head north.”</p>
