<p id="page_86" class="calibre7">Episode Two</p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre7">From up on a hill that towered above the treetops, Saku looked down on the camp. The fire had been put out and the flap of the tent had been closed. She held out the skull so that it could see, feeling completely silly while doing it, but Kamo complained about being in the pocket for too long.</p>
<p class="calibre7">After walking down from the hill she carefully crept towards the camp, dust swirling in the air above her.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“He must be asleep or something.” She whispered to the skull in her pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Stop talking before he hears you.” The skull said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She heard a snap. She threw Kamo in the direction the sound had come from. His face slid in the dirt until he once again was facing her.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Hey!!!!” He shouted, with a twinge of hurt in his voice. “I may be dead. But my feelings aren’t yet. I am not a weapon!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You had it coming.” Her eyes darted around, back to the tent. As if she expected him to come out of it. He didn’t. After a few moments she went to Kamo and picked him up again. “He’s gone.” She said, still looking around. “Why would he leave?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku carefully approached the tent, and slowly opened the flap.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The skull screamed. Saku dropped the cover. Then paused and slowly turned. Kamo might have been smiling if he had lips instead of a bone beak.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You fell for that?” Kamo asked. “You scare easily.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku threw the skull into the soft dirt. After, she noticed all the items that had once been inside the tent were now gone. Including the tea. But the katana lay in the middle, seemingly waiting for her.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She approached the sword and knelt down. “Why would Ayashi leave his this? That man is crazy, Kamo.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Not as crazy ugly as that dress he was wearing.” He said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I'm telling you I have the same dress. Why does a duck even have an opinion on what I wear? How are we supposed to find Ayashi now? I need to get that tea back. He could be anywhere!”</p>
<p id="page_87" class="calibre7">“If you want my advice,” Kamo said. “Burn the dress. That’s not a good color for your skin tone. If you want more of my advice, let’s head to the city. If this Ayashi is as unhinged as he looked, someone will know about him and where he is.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku cursed. “Why do I keep talking to you, you aren’t real. I don’t know how to get to the city. Ayashi said he was going to take me.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“He totally wasn’t going to take you.” Kamo said laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She muttered some unkind words under before saying. “I know that now! ”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“If I could see the mountains in all this dust, I could point you in the right direction.” Kamo said. “You’re going to Shao Song like this others right? There’s an old lady near an apple tree who used to make great pickles. I used to go to with some of my friends. We’d get up high in the trees so we could see when she was washing her clothes. Then, we’d knock over the clay pots, and enjoy the good eating.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Wait, you know how to get to the Shao Song. Because you eat, pickles?” She shook her head. “Yeah you are not real. I am nuts. Mibu can never know I drank the tea. She’d never speak to me again.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku turned to look high up at the trees. She put the skull in her pocket and grabbed onto the bark. Soon, she climbed far up enough to reach for sturdy branches. Though sore, she managed to make it to the top. Still the dust covered the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Kamo began complaining about the darkness of the pocket, when Saku grabbed him and tossed him as high into the air as she could. She expected the skull to fall straight down, but she could see nothing past the leaves of the tree. Suddenly he fell from the dusty air into her vision. She leaned out as far as she could and reached for the skull. Her finger caught his eye hole.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You jerk!” He screamed. “You almost shattered me. Stop dropping me!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’m sorry.” She climbed down the tree. “I figured you’d be able to see if I got you up high enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I did! The mountains are to our left, so we need to keep heading straight up the river. The dust should clear with those wind currents. No more throwing me!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No promises, but I’ll try.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I never expected a skull person to act like this! Have some respect! I shouldn’t have to tell you that!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Well if by some miracle you actually do lead me to Shao Song, and I’m not just standing in the middle of the forest talking to myself, I’ll consider it.” Saku said.</p>
<p id="page_88" class="calibre7">She searched around the camp for anything else she might need on her journey but found only a water container. She filled it by the river and headed towards the city.</p>
<p class="calibre7">–</p>
<p class="calibre7">There was no moon that night, and a layer of dust blanketed the horizon. She squinted in the dark and held her hands in front of her as she walked through the forest. Her hand struck a tree at the same time that her knees hit a thorny bush. She cursed.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I can’t see anything. Which means, there’s no city here Kamo. I shouldn’t have listened to you!” Saku shouted at the skull.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Oh? What’s that up ahead?” He said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She noticed the dim lights in the distance. As they approached, the night sky cleared, revealing a city illuminated by scattered, decorated paper lanterns. Banners waved out front of shops, and people in brightly colored kimonos chatted amongst themselves. The scent of cut grass on newly built doors and walls overwhelmed Saku. She had never seen buildings taller than the trees before.</p>
<p class="calibre7">‘You got lucky.” She told the skull. “All cities are built by water. I’m sure I knew that. This means nothing.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I was right. You have to believe me now.” He said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She held the skull higher towards the shops, still busy with people. “What is everyone doing out so late at night? Don’t they have to work in the morning?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“They’re buying stuff?” The skull said. “What, you don’t buy stuff? Maybe from the money you make selling all that tea you spend all day growing?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku suddenly realized others could hear, and see her talking to the skull. She put it away in her upper right pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Hey! I was talking!” The skull said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I can’t keep talking to you.” She whispered. “I’ll look. Not normal.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“So?” The skull said back, Kamo’s voice now sounded muffled through the fabric of Saku’s pocket. “Everyone is crazy in the city. The crazier you are, the more power you have.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“If I get caught…” she began to say.</p>
<p id="page_89" class="calibre7">She noticed a young girl with light brown hair and a patched together blue kimono staring at her. Saku looked away and whispered. “That kid sees us. If the castle finds out I am here without the tea… Look what you…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The child ran up to Saku and tugged at her pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Is that a talking skull!” The kid said, lifting up on her toes to speak to the foreign person.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You never talk into your pocket for fun?” Saku tried to hurry away from the child, but she followed her behind a push cart selling dried fish and clay cooked sweet potatoes.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“We don’t have pockets.” The child said. “Are you friends with Oniku?!” A boy in a old kimono with a blue cap ran to her and used his arm to push the girl back. She swatted away the arm.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Leave her alone, Sister! They don’t like to talk when they’ve not working at the freak show.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku gently squeezed Kamo, as if she were asking him what she should do. Kamo responded, laughing. “Tell her. What’s the worst that can happen? Those people ducklings aren’t going to tell anyone.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku sighed, then smiled slightly at the young girl still filled with excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Okay.” Saku said in a whisper. She put a finger to her lips. “I am Saku, of the pocket people.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Tell Oniku she should do more tricks and talk less.” Her brother’s face soured from annoyance. He picked up his sister and carried her over his shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“But I wanted one of those skull flowers they were selling!” She said. The boy did not respond and kept walking. She waved to Saku. She waved back the boy stopped in the middle of the street. Someone was coming.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The skull laughed violently from inside her pocket. “They thought you were part of a <i class="calibre13">Misemono</i> freak show.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The streets grew quiet. A man in iron and leather armor, laced together with red wool and appeared with a torch in hand. He wore a kabuto with a gold trimmed visor around the helmet. With his other hand he revealed a piece of paper, with the words “Wanted.” in their tongue.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Another skuller has gone missing.” The man spoke. “The regent wishes for them to be found and brought to the castle immediately. Fifty coins will be given for her capture. Alive. Unless she is without the shipment, then he will accept her head. Search the outskirts.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">The memory of Mibu telling her not to talk came to her mind. She disappeared into a closed unlit shop away from the commotion in the streets. But not before seeing the boy and the girl approach the soldier.</p>
<p id="page_90" class="calibre7">Saku squatted down behind the wooden counter beneath stacked white ramen bowls with blue trim. The world was silent, and shadows of the people standing too afraid to move fluttered on the transparent rice paper wall.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Great. They know I’m here because I listened to you! What is a Misemono and how do we get there?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Why don’t you know anything? That’s where you can go to see famous weird people. I once saw a dragon mummy there. Least that’s what they were telling people was behind the wrapping. Let me get this straight Saku, you are now planning to go up to a bunch of famous people off the street and hope they tell you what to do?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku let out a puff of air. “I have a better idea, Kamo! I’m going to do nothing, and just stand here.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">They paused.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Well, that’s not productive at all.” The skull said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“It’s not. But that was our only other option, and we tried it. So, shut up and let me handle this. They have to know who would steal tea leaves there. Oniku might be able to help. She might know how to rid of this tea illness so I stop talking to myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Goooood luck with that.” Kamo said as he was placed back in Saku’s pocket. She left the shop through the backdoor in the kitchen next to the firepit, passing a wooden tray with leftover noodles. Incense sticks placed nearby burned, its smoke rose up towards the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre7">–</p>
<p class="calibre7">They traveled past a bridge that towered over a dried up river to the plaza. Reed walls hung around the carnival perimeter, suspended by posts to block off the outside world. She found the entrance, and exchanged a palm full of rice for admission. A man with a large straw hat and face paint accepted the payment and motioned them inside. He watched her, not blinking, as she wandered into the masses of spectators.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Hey Kamo.” Saku said. “Those… people ducklings back there… called each other brother and sister. Is that normal here?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Aren’t I just a crazy hallucination? Why are you asking me? What do you mean is that normal?” The skull asked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Being allowed to know who your family is? Out in the open. Being seen with them?” She asked.</p>
<p id="page_91" class="calibre7">“Pretty sure that’s a common peoples thing.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Not in my village.” She said, looking down. “We aren’t even supposed to have relationships without conqueror approval.” Something about seeing the children together had tugged at her soul.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Oh. Well. I’m not a peoples expert.” Kamo said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Singing filled the air inside the bright bazaar-like atmosphere. A woman dressed as a samurai danced and sung on stage around vender carts and stalls. Nearby a man held a pair of scissors in the air shouting “Get your haircuts here! Ponytails half-off!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Contestants played with blow darts at booths trying to hit a circle on a piece of parchment. Grass huts and a main stage crafted from bamboo had signs above them, such as “Large bird swallows hot coals here!” or “It’s a real camel! 1 coin.” From carts and booths workers in tattered clothes took down signs and put away items, such as handmade dolls and painted pieces of wood with characters on them.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Oniku!” Saku pointed to a sign on the far end of the stage, lit in a very dark blue lantern light.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She lowered her head and made her way across the Misemono through the crowds, bypassing the stage trying to hide behind the huts as much as she could. To her dismay, the Oniku booth had a rope with a sign attached. “Closed”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You wanna buy a doll?” Saku heard a deep voice behind her. She turned and grabbed at the skull in her pocket. The sword swung against her arm as she did.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Woah now.” The voice said. The towering man came to stand in front of Saku, with his large bulging muscles. He had a very pronounced forehead and two large bumps that almost looked like horns. “We don’t need violence here.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Oh!” She pulled the sword off of her shoulder and held the handle so that it pointed downward. “I’m not attacking anyone, you scared me.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Scare you? You’re the one who came here with a weapon. You shouldn’t have even been let in.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I don’t know who you are.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“He’s Oni-chan!” The skull said in a high pitched voice.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I am Oni-chan.” He said, not hearing the skull. Or not responding to it if he did. “We are closing as soon as the performance is finished. We open tomorrow morning, it’s half price for you little ones.” He squinted at Saku. He observed for a moment, before looking to her pockets.</p>
<p id="page_92" class="calibre7">“Little one? I’m an adult. I am looking for Ayashi. He took something from me.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Sure you are.” He winked. “I know nothing of Ayashi or of the words that came out of your mouth. I can’t help you. Have a good night.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">He looked again to Saku’s pocket. His mouth dropped and looked at her in astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Um. Hello? My face is up here.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You. Are one of those skull people aren’t you?” He said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I am from Fukui.” She said. “You know you called me a slur right. Hard R and everything?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Forgive me.” He said. “I am from the old generation. Why are you here? I’m guessing it’s not to see the camel.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I need to get a bag from a ronin name Ayashi. Before someone finds out I’m here without the regents' goods. Also, I hear there is another here who has pockets who might be able to help with an issue I am having.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I’m glad you’re saying this out in the open, Saku. So everyone know’s your here. Good thinking!” Kamo said from the pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan looked down in disappointment. “The show is over. Go home.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No. I demand to see Oniku.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He looked at her, blankly.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“No. You don’t understand. You can’t be here.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">She squinted her eyes. “A little girl told me you were selling flowers that were once grown in my village. Someone here knows something about them. Unless, you are scamming people by selling fake flowers.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">He raised his hands in defense. “Hey now, I’m trying to help you. They are fake. Don’t accuse me of selling those flowers they have by the castle if that is what you are meaning. Anything we sell is purely symbolic and not the flower itself. Do you know what the punishment is for getting caught with one of those things?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Show me what you are selling then.” She said, not knowing what the flowers looked like.</p>
<p id="page_93" class="calibre7">“I’m not doing that.” He sighed. “I tried. Leave now or I’m calling Kappa over here to have you removed.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku turned to the last remaining people slowly making their way out of the carnival. She cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted as loud as she could. “FRUAD! That’s not a real camel! That’s a mountain whale in disguise!”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You have no proof! Stop spreading lies!” He tried to step out in front of her, but she went on.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Who needs proof, I can yell whatever I want.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Doesn’t that lord Yataku want your head? Should you be shouting?” Kamo said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan saw people starting to notice the commotion.</p>
<p class="calibre7">The large man gently pulled Saku aside and cuffed his hand over her ear and whispered. “You are letting everyone know you are here! You know you are wanted.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I will keep shouting until I get what I want.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan frowned, and addressed the remaining crowd. “Goodnight everyone! See you tomorrow!” He winked and smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He turned to Saku. “I was afraid this day would come. I’ll take you to Oniku, but I think it might be a waste of time. I feel you are going to insist.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Pretty much, yeah.” Saku said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Follow me.” He motioned his hand towards a larger building across the way.</p>
<p class="calibre7">–</p>
<p class="calibre7">The candles released a faint sweet smell that lingered in the hut. There was an opening that led into what had been a stable but now served as a storage room for peach baby dolls for Momotaro’s long lost relative. Saku felt herself gripping at the sword. Oni-Chan appeared from behind a giant water barrel, now wearing a black cloak with a large hood.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Oniku is not here.” He said. “But. I am going to perform to you, the very act she gives nightly.” His voice came out sheepish. Saku thought he looked embarrassed. He picked up a fake skull, and began to speak to it. “Well hello there Jasaro!” His pitch rose to that of a convincing woman.</p>
<p class="calibre7">He used skull like a puppet. He spoke in a weird accent that made the puppet seem very unsophisticated. “Golly Madame Oni-ku! I done hadn’t seen you all day! You dun drunk some tea didn’t you Ms. Oniku?”</p>
<p id="page_94" class="calibre7">“Oh, you know I did! That’s the only time you talk back! I always drink my crazy tea before I eat…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku cursed, loudly, and held out her hand. “That’s enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan stopped, still holding the skull in mid-sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Is that. What everyone thinks we are?” She said. “We work so hard for you. And. That’s it? You make fun of us for something... most of us haven’t done in a hundred years?”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That’s only what they have been told about you. I do not mean to be offensive. I do this act to make a living. Nothing more.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku fought back tears, thinking of all the long days and extra nights she had put in to ensure that shipments could be made in time.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“You knowingly make fun of my people? For profit? That’s disgusting.” She turned away and looked down to floor, watching the shadows from peach babies dolls.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan put down his skull. “I never thought of it that way. I’m here to make a living. Sometimes that hurts others. So yes. The flowers we sell are fake. I’ve never seen a real pocket person who has partaken of the flower tea. They do not exist.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I need to find Ayashi. I need to get it back and delivered to Lord Yataku. Before they. Do something to me. Or mibu.” She said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Oni-chan put his hand to his chin and thought. “I still do not know any Ayashi’s. But look for the machi-yakko in the market district. The commoners who patrol the city will be gathered there, eating after their shifts. If there’s a Ronnin here, one of them will know. I will. retire the Oniku act…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">A woman with scales for skin poked her head through the door, panting.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Lord Yutaka is here. Someone saw the skuller yelling during the show, what do we...” The lady spotted Saku and cleared her throat. “I mean the skull person.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Get out of here.” Oni-chan said sternly, pointing to the back of the hut. “Push aside the wall, before he finds you.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Moments after crawling through the secret opening, she heard someone burst into the hut. Followed by a hand smack. The voice rang out loud and angry.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Where, is she?” It said.</p>
<p id="page_95" class="calibre7">“Someone must have been mistaken.” Saku heard Oni-chan say. “There is no…”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Something or someone struck Oni-chan hard, over and over. He grunted out in pain, gasping, spitting.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Bring this hideous liar to the castle.” He said, seemingly to others who had entered the room.</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku felt a hand on her shoulders. She jumped.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“This way.” The man with the straw hat said.</p>
<p class="calibre7">When Saku left that night, creeping past royal guards who surrounded the Misemono, she left with an Oni-chan doll and a mermaid handbag she had been given on the way out by the man who took her admission. They made their way into the night towards the market district.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“That Oni-chan really went all out for you. I wouldn’t get beat up for you.” Kamo said. “And, I thought the act was pretty funny.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku, despite how she felt, didn’t fling the skull into the sky in the middle of the night but did give it a whack on the top of its head with her index finger. The shops had closed for the night and only a few lanterns were lit. Because of this, a vast array of stars hovered above Saku. She stared at them, as she often did when it was clear, and wondered.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I thought I would find help here.” Saku said. “There is no help. I’m on my own. And I can not fail. I’m going to find a way to free Oni-chan. I won’t allow anyone else to get hurt because of me.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">“I mean, I got us here.” Kamo said. “I’d call that helping. Yes, I told you to tell the ducklings who you were so I did mess up. But you had a shouting match that let everyone know where you were, so maybe we should call it even.”</p>
<p class="calibre7">Saku found herself smiling at this. She wiped it off her face as soon as she heard screaming. She looked to see where the noise was coming from.</p>
<p class="calibre7">“Isn’t that where we are going?” Kamo asked.</p>
<p class="calibre7">She kept walking toward the screams. Her pace quickened.</p>
