<p id="page_22" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Episode 3 Two for One</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We got as far away as we could from the crazy old future “me” and retreated to my other</span> <span class="calibre2">thinking spot, the Neonopolis outdoor mall, which was not far from the coffee shop. It felt like</span> <span class="calibre2">having a private space. No one would be there. Even though it had only recently opened, it</span> <span class="calibre2">already felt like a ghost town. We took the escalator up to where the buttery scent of popcorn</span> <span class="calibre2">from the open yet already abandoned movie theater overwhelmed us. From the top floor we</span> <span class="calibre2">could look down at the food court and if the old psychopath came looking for us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Did that happen?” I asked. Had I really met my future self?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It better not have.” Mia scoffed. “There better be a gas leak at the coffee shop, and that. Person.</span> <span class="calibre2">Isn’t…” She trailed off and stared into the blackened glass of a window of the former high end</span> <span class="calibre2">fashion shop. The store lasted a week. The armless mannequins seemed to be looking at Mia.</span> <span class="calibre2">“But unlike those creepy things. I think it is real. Is this all my fault?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What do you mean? What is your fault? That we are going to miss school today? ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia grabbed the PDA out of my left hand. “Why can’t you understand anything I talk to you</span> <span class="calibre2">about. The delivery date on this says 2022. Like, It doesn’t expect us to stand here with coffee</span> <span class="calibre2">and wait around forever, does it? Where do we deliver this for money?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Didn’t you just say not long ago that you don’t blame me for stuff?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She gave me a cold hard look. I returned one, and we stood in awkward silence for what felt like</span> <span class="calibre2">a million years. Finally, she bit her lip. “The pocket computer thing says we have fifteen minutes,</span> <span class="calibre2">why is there a timer? I thought we were time traveling?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She started pressing ‘buttons’. She’s good at that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The PDA shook and hummed as loud as a jet engine. “Don’t do that! That’s not even yours, Turn</span> <span class="calibre2">it off!” I freaked out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I can’t stop it.” She cried.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We saw a flash. Everything went dark.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p id="page_23" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">When we came to, we stood in an empty Neonopolis. That part was normal, but all the shops in</span> <span class="calibre2">the outdoor mall looked vacant. We were standing in the dark on the wrong side of a dusty</span> <span class="calibre2">“closed sign”. Only some of the the neon signs that we recognized from 2002 still worked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The time travel device started speaking. “Welcome to the year 2022. This PDA time travel trip</span> <span class="calibre2">has been sponsored by Elon’s Cabbage! Satisfy that crunchy cabbage craving with a taste of</span> <span class="calibre2">Elon! Now verified!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Do they use cabbage when they barbecue your Mongolians? We got to get this delivered if we</span> <span class="calibre2">want that money,”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I grunted. “The list of forbidden words.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah whatever.” She mumbled. “Doesn’t look like our rules helped us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What the hell?” I put my hands on my hips. “Do you know how many forbidden words I</span> <span class="calibre2">struggle with when talking to you? I feel like I have to censor myself so much that I…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Do you know what your problem is?” She interpreted. I found myself letting off a growl in</span> <span class="calibre2">annoyance, though I sounded more like a kitten than a tiger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That I have someone nagging me all the time who doesn’t get I’m trying really really hard?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Your problem is you don’t try hard at all. You can’t do anything that might be convenient. You</span> <span class="calibre2">just complain about it and don’t try to fix it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We don’t have time for this, let’s go.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It’s fine.” She said. Of course everyone know’s those words don’t mean that. She might have</span> <span class="calibre2">well have thrown a spoon at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We hurried out of the outdoor mall and onto Fremont Street. People walked around us. The</span> <span class="calibre2">casino lights flashed, and slot machines clanked from a distance. Paint from a street artist</span> <span class="calibre2">sprayed into the warm air. Music from our time blasted through speakers hanging on the</span> <span class="calibre2">jumbotron overhead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“This is the future, huh?” I asked. We stopped and looked around, together. Looking at all the</span> <span class="calibre2">lights and sights around us.</span></p>
<p id="page_24" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I already don’t want it to be.” She said, deep in her thoughts. She grabbed the CD player from</span> <span class="calibre2">my hoodie pocket to drown them out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Above the front door was an enormous banner that read “FuKuYu”, and everyone had to walk</span> <span class="calibre2">under it to get into the store. She put the CD player back in my hoodie pocket as we walked</span> <span class="calibre2">inside shaking our heads.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“FuKuYu family market? That sounds like someone made a joke but no one got it but they kept it</span> <span class="calibre2">anyways.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia pointed at a giant poster on the back wall. On it was an old lady with her thumb sticking up</span> <span class="calibre2">against a background of lilies. The poster read “Neighborhood market fifty percent off canned</span> <span class="calibre2">tuna day.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Dr. Tan-aka?” I whispered in amazement. “Did my therapist quit and buy a grocery store?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“After meeting your future self? I know why.” She deadpanned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I need a drink.” I paused. “Water. Not that kind of drink.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I got it.” She instantly headed to the short fridges near the register full of glass marble soda and</span> <span class="calibre2">other drinks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The order didn’t say where we were taking the coffee, so we started looking around. FuKuYu</span> <span class="calibre2">family market had a bunch of weird stuff in it. Mostly things wrapped in rice and seaweed. The</span> <span class="calibre2">air smelled sweet from the bread baking at the back of the store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The woman at the register waved us down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Is that my Lost coffee?” The woman loosely swung her arms. “It should be order sixty-six?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Here you go. One Lost coffee.” I handed her the order trying to smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Did I offend you?” The clerk asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s how they smile.” Mia explained.</span></p>
<p id="page_25" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She took a large sip, closing her eyes and tilting her head. She slurped, and made a strange noise</span> <span class="calibre2">as if she was enjoying it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s the taste I’ve missed for 20 years. Makes me want to read poetry. This cost a lot of</span> <span class="calibre2">money for coffee, but.” She hummed classical pieces of music to herself. “This two-for-one deal</span> <span class="calibre2">was worth it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia grabbed my shoulder. “Two for one?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah! Azami delivered the other coffee five minutes ago at 9:35. I gave the first one to my boss.</span> <span class="calibre2">Take the waters as a tip, I’ll cover for you. Thanks again for the discount!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What do you mean two for one?” My eyes turned to the time on the PDA. The time read 9:41.</span> <span class="calibre2">Which was different from the time displayed at the store by about twenty minutes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia dragged me away from the counter, holding two giant plastic water bottles. “It means we</span> <span class="calibre2">didn’t make the delivery first. Your other self must have gotten the money from the order.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The device chimed as we walked out of the air-conditioned store back into the hot parking lot.</span> <span class="calibre2">On the screen now appeared my name and A ZAM EE’s name. Under mine showed zero dollars.</span> <span class="calibre2">A ZAM EE’s had two thousand under it. I pushed the screen almost to her face, knowing her</span> <span class="calibre2">vision sucks, to show she was right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“If you wouldn’t have fought with me we might have gotten her first.” She pointed. “Find</span> <span class="calibre2">another order, something with a big bonus.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A voice called out from inside the store. “Azami!” The store doors opened. I turned around to a</span> <span class="calibre2">shocked older Japanese lady wearing a store uniform.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Oh no.” She sighed. “You took that delivery job.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Hi, Dr. Tan-aka!” I said waving. “You look great!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She frowned. Something about the sight of Mia seemed to trouble Dr. Tan-ake. She stood</span> <span class="calibre2">looking uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We’re friends now,” Mia said, trying to figure out why she was letting off those very obvious</span> <span class="calibre2">weird vibes. “The trauma bonded us or something.”</span></p>
<p id="page_26" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Tan-aka blinked. “You’re trauma bonding. Yes.” She closed one eye and tightened her lips. “I</span> <span class="calibre2">don’t do that anymore. I’m glad to see you worked things out. For a minute. Hey Aurore, tell</span> <span class="calibre2">your older self to move their van. It’s been out front all month. I’m going to get it towed if they</span> <span class="calibre2">can’t get it going.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Van?” My words fumbled as they came out. “I have a van?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She pointed to the corner of the parking lot. I recognized something I had not seen on the way</span> <span class="calibre2">inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Is that your aunt Bianca’s van?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">There parked at the far end, taking up two spots sat the hippie van. Super-sized wheels, giant side</span> <span class="calibre2">windows. The van might as well have had a surfboard attached to the roof.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I peeked in the back windows, walking around to the front. The sun reflected off of something</span> <span class="calibre2">sitting on the front seat. I put my hand to my forehead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“My license,” I whispered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My wallet sat opened up with my DMV photo out in plain view. My soul died a little. “And my</span> <span class="calibre2">emotional support hoodie.” The fabric had seen better days. The more worrying part was the</span> <span class="calibre2">empty beer cans and plastic whiskey bottles littered about.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia choked on her words. “Why’s your stuff in my van?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know,” I felt my hands shake the more I thought about a future living in a parking lot.</span> <span class="calibre2">Where were my friends? Why didn't I have a family?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I thought about finding a rock to break the window, but realized the door was unlocked. Also, it</span> <span class="calibre2">wouldn’t right the wrong of the DMV photo. Mia stood staring at her reflection in the passenger</span> <span class="calibre2">side mirror.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My eyes turned to the back of the van. The back looked like a trash-themed adventure park. The</span> <span class="calibre2">seats had been removed, and off to the left side lay a sleeping bag on a mountain of clothes. To</span> <span class="calibre2">the right was a wall of stuff with a backpack I recognized. The side saddle bag, the one I had</span> <span class="calibre2">forgotten to take to school and left in Mia’s room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Do you see anything of mine?” She asked. “Are you sure it’s Azamee’s? Cause you wouldn’t</span> <span class="calibre2">buy this without me right? Unless, my aunt had to sell it for some reason.”</span></p>
<p id="page_27" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m not seeing anything that looks like it's yours. Why do-”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Where am I then? Is that why your future self is…” She stop abruptly. I motioned for her to go</span> <span class="calibre2">on, but she refused. The look on her face reminded me of when Ms. Kay turned off my birthday</span> <span class="calibre2">tape mix, as if the sadness was causing active pain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“This is a joke universe. This isn’t what's going to happen in twenty-one years is it? You, gone?</span> <span class="calibre2">Me, living out of the back of a van? Worth nothing? Is is all there is?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She stuck out her hand. “That’s a little dramatic. We don’t know anything yet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia opened the door and found keys that had been tossed on the driver side floor. She reached</span> <span class="calibre2">over and put the keys in the ignition. She tried to start the van. The engine made a clanking metal</span> <span class="calibre2">sound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She gasped. “This is my van” A moment later the hood popped, and she hit some car thing near</span> <span class="calibre2">the top. “Now try it.” She mumbled, pointing towards the ignition.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I turned the key. The engine started.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The hood of the van closed shut. I got in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I can’t live in a van!” I said. “This isn’t what I wanted at all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">At hearing this, Mia hit the steering wheel hard. She sat for a moment, before revving the engine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I wanted the van so we could get out of here. Away from Vegas, and all the sad stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I lowered my head, disgusted at myself. “We have to change this. I don’t know what this is but I</span> <span class="calibre2">don’t like it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It’s useless.” She said. “We’ve watched those movies. All that stuff is impossible to change.</span> <span class="calibre2">Someone ends up dying, or someone learns some bull lesson.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Salmon. Like the fish!” An audiobook suddenly played through the beat-up side speakers. You</span> <span class="calibre2">know how the electronics work in that thing. She turned it off.</span></p>
<p id="page_28" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“It won't matter what happens in the future or whatever. This is a different dimension. Once we</span> <span class="calibre2">end the shift. With this van full of money. We can do what we want and fix everything.” Mia</span> <span class="calibre2">shifted the clutch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why didn’t you tell me you wanted the van for us? I would have tried to have helped you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“No. You wouldn’t have.” She said. She floored the petal and roared out of the Fukuyu parking</span> <span class="calibre2">lot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">As the van drove down the road, I looked at orders on the device. She pointed to one of the</span> <span class="calibre2">orders. “Find one.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I found one.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Hey! That’s your address! Our address, I mean. Your mom. Your Future other mother must be</span> <span class="calibre2">ordering something. It wont be a problem if other me shows up. We can team up to beat them</span> <span class="calibre2">down if they do. ”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The order was for a sandwich from a pizza place we go to, from 2001. Spinnerbait Pizza. The</span> <span class="calibre2">retro ocean-y setup was cool, but the music they played annoyed both of us. It was the kind of</span> <span class="calibre2">music that would sound a lot better in a car wash than it does over speakers. Either way, we</span> <span class="calibre2">knew the place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Your other you didn’t look like they liked me.” Mia went on. “I bet other older you won’t take</span> <span class="calibre2">this order. Even if the bonus is five thousand dollars.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Mia.” I stopped. I took a deep breath. “My future self is a… I can’t think of anything nice. A</span> <span class="calibre2">jerk with short ugly hair. But you’re always going to be awesome to me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She’s like, “I kind of liked the short hair on you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I stared at her for a second. In disbelief. Instead of saying something, feeling a fight coming on, I</span> <span class="calibre2">looked back to the PDA.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Sponsored order?” I stared down. “This says after we complete this we can do sponsored orders</span> <span class="calibre2">for more money.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Sponsored by whom? How much more money?” She asked.</span></p>
<p id="page_29" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know. But we should find out.” I accepted the order and Mia made a left turn driving</span> <span class="calibre2">towards the pizza shop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">After picking up the sandwich in 2001, we returned to Mia’s house in 2022. Something seemed</span> <span class="calibre2">unsettling about the place now. Maybe it was the collection of garden gnomes sat by the</span> <span class="calibre2">entrance. Or the garbage laying. It wasn’t how the house was usally kept.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia walked to the door and tried to open it. But the knob didn’t turn. She tried her key, but the</span> <span class="calibre2">key didn’t fit. She banged on the wood. “Yo, mom it’s me. We got the sandwich.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">After a bit, we heard footsteps from the other side. For a moment Mia took a step forward, to</span> <span class="calibre2">enter but stopped. Like she didn’t believe her own eyes. I expected Ms. Kaye to come out of the</span> <span class="calibre2">house, but she didn’t.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Instead stranger stood there. Dressed in fine dinner date sort of clothes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Who are you?” Mia asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You have my food?” The woman asked back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yeah,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Thanks.” She grabbed the sandwich. “You know when the second one getting here? I got a party</span> <span class="calibre2">starting and I owe my sister-in-law a sandwich too. Have you tried these? They are so good. It’s</span> <span class="calibre2">the peppercorns that really make the flavor pop.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Does anyone else live here? Does my Mom live here?” Mia asked with concern.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know you.” The woman replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Do you know who lived here before?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“No.” The stranger seemed uneasy. “We bought it. In an estate sale twenty years ago. I’m going</span> <span class="calibre2">to eat this now. Good night.” She closed the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">We walked away from the house. As we stood, looking down at the shadows cast by the</span> <span class="calibre2">flickering light, Mia’s eyes narrowed.</span></p>
<p id="page_30" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She covered her face with her hands. “This isn’t real, is it? What happened?” Her body rocked</span> <span class="calibre2">back and forth. She folded her arms. We tried to search AOL on the device to see if we could</span> <span class="calibre2">find out what happened to Ms. Kay and Mia. But we couldn't find any real information.</span> <span class="calibre2">Everything lead us to advertisements for funeral home services and french fry sale codes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“ This isn’t something we can fix, is it?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why isn’t my Mom here?” Mia bowed her head. “We’d never sell that house.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Had I failed Ms. Kaye? The thought punched me in the gut.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The plan doesn’t change.” I said, pointing to the PDA. “We can take a sponsored order. We can</span> <span class="calibre2">still make as much money as we possible can.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What does it matter? If I’m dead?” Mia said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m not going to let that happen.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I looked through the jobs on the device. I found one and held the phone to Mia’s face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Look at the amount on this order.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She squinted. Her eyes widened at the number on the screen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Instead of watching a rightfully emotional Mia drive that clunky van, I checked my watch.</span> <span class="calibre2">Which was useless. Time traveling between dimensions is confusing. Is that what jet lag feels</span> <span class="calibre2">like I wonder?</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She parked the van at the stadium, which totally wasn’t there in 2002, and I pulled up the order.</span> <span class="calibre2">On the screen, we found two front row tickets at the 50 yard line, as well as the parking pass that</span> <span class="calibre2">we used to get in, which the device printed out for us. The delivery notes instructed us to wait in</span> <span class="calibre2">the seats until further notice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I could see tears dripping from Mia’s cheeks. It crushed my soul. Not two seconds after parking I</span> <span class="calibre2">see a familiar jerk coming at us from the other side of the parking lot. Their walk seemed to be</span> <span class="calibre2">more stumbly this time.</span></p>
<p id="page_31" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Hey!” They shouted. “You stole my van! I had to take a stranger’s car here! How did you get it</span> <span class="calibre2">running?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I do not want to talk to you, A-zam-ee.” I yelled out the window.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Azami!” They pounded on the back window. We got out of the van.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“How did you know where we were?” I asked. I could still smell “The weekend twelve pack” on</span> <span class="calibre2">my breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Find my phone.” Azami said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You mean your device? It’s in your hands stupid!” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What happened to me?” Mia asked my future self. “Why is someone else living at my house?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You might have moved. It’s been years.” My future self suggested, cold, rehearsed. They</span> <span class="calibre2">quickly peered into the back of the vehicle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We tell each other everything. Aurore.” Mia said to my future self. “Why wouldn’t you tell me</span> <span class="calibre2">this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Azami threw up their hands in frustration. “There’s a lot of things that are not like how I want</span> <span class="calibre2">them. But I can’t change any of that. This isn’t Back to the Future.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I poked them in the chest. “You are going to tell me everything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m not doing anything you ask me to do there, little foot,” They laughed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I took a step closer to them. “I’m not asking.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I can’t. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Apology loop.” I reminded myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’m not bound by your rules.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia threw her hands in the air. “I ... can’t deal with two of you. I need a moment.”</span></p>
<p id="page_32" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’ll be right there, I’m going to-”. Before I could finish talking, she reached inside my hoodie</span> <span class="calibre2">pocket pulling out the CD player.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I super need these right now.” Which I knew.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Give me back my keys?!” Azami yelled, pointing at Mia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You can pry them from my cold dead fingers,” She said, putting in the earbuds. She hurried</span> <span class="calibre2">inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The hell, dude?” I pushed my future self, who to my surprise was a lot lighter than I expected. I</span> <span class="calibre2">noticed I could see the outline of my own ribs through the dress shirt. “What… What are you</span> <span class="calibre2">doing? With life? What is wrong with you? Why would you treat her like that? After all she has</span> <span class="calibre2">done for us?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We. Dude.” My other self said. “We. Don’t go penning all this on me. You’re better off without</span> <span class="calibre2">that narcissist.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I don’t know what came over me. But I hit them. Right there in the parking lot. Closed fist and</span> <span class="calibre2">all. They stumbled back into someone elses car, touching their bloody lip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I will cut you.” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Azami laughed at this. “You are so under her control you have no idea how brainwashed you</span> <span class="calibre2">are.” They said turning back to the stadium. “She doesn’t just boss you around dude. She</span> <span class="calibre2">controls you. She uses your emotions to manipulate you. But you are so stupi bd you can’t even</span> <span class="calibre2">figure it out. I get tired of this conversation. We have this fight every time I take a shift. I’m sick</span> <span class="calibre2">of it. You never figure it out. And you never will. You didn’t mention it this time, but it’s not Dr.</span> <span class="calibre2">Tan-aka but it’s Dr. Tanaka. You idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t care about your opinion, or how many shifts you’ve taken..” I yelled. “Where. Is future</span> <span class="calibre2">Mia?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I don’t know. I wouldn’t tell you even if I did.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You’re lying.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Believe whatever you want.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I gave up on myself and let them go inside. I tried to settle my emotions before trying to find</span> <span class="calibre2">Mia, but after a few minutes I had to head in. I knew I wasn’t going to calm down. Because I</span> <span class="calibre2">knew somehow, someway, I was to blame for what happened. And I didn’t know what to do</span> <span class="calibre2">about it.</span></p>
<p id="page_33" class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">As soon as I found my seat Mia grabbed my CD collection I kept in my emotional support</span> <span class="calibre2">hoodie pocket and quickly flipped through all the CDs in the case.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“This is all you brought? You steal my entire dream life but can’t bring a CD I like.” Mia</span> <span class="calibre2">frowned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I froze. Thinking of all the things I could say. “My bad.” I sat down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I didn’t mean to snap. I don’t mean it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Are you okay?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What do you think.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">“Are you having Jr. High cheer-leader flashbacks?” I thought it was funny, and that a joke would</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">lighten the mood. Since she did not like being forced to do cheer in Jr. High, as you know. She</span> <span class="calibre2">did not. She straightened up and pulled back her hair from her earbuds. About to yell. We heard a</span> <span class="calibre2">familiar voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You’re in my seat.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">“Mia’s in your seat,” I said, talking to my older self who arrived with a beer in their hand. They</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">scoffed at me and sat next to us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Future me waved their arms in the air, trying not to spill their beer. “Yeah, I’m the big scary</span> <span class="calibre2">monster. I get it kid.” They mocked. “I’m the ghost of the future you!” They laughed an evil</span> <span class="calibre2">laugh. They found it funny, I guess. They chugged their entire beer then threw the empty plastic</span> <span class="calibre2">cup down to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Don’t call me kid,” I told them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Why are they here?” She pointed at my other self with a look of disgust.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“That’s how this works.” Azami said.</span></p>
<p id="page_34" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Then why weren’t you at the last one?” Mia asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Azami didn’t say anything. Mia changed the track on the CD player.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Music played over the stadium speakers. “It’s your Las Vegas Looters vs The Phoenix Hot</span> <span class="calibre2">CoMmAnDeRs. This game has been sponsored by FUTURE TREATS. We got you at Future</span> <span class="calibre2">Treats. Meet our Future Treat trained professionals who are squaring off as a treat FOR YOU!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Realizing everyone in the stadium can see you in your emotional support hoodie was not cool. I</span> <span class="calibre2">tried to smile for everyone watching the jumbotron but I looked mad again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The winner, who signed a waiver, will get 2 million dollars if they win! No rules.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Two million dollars? That wasn't what the order amount was for. I turned to Mia, who stood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I sighed. “This is the weirdest birthday ever,”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Shut up and do something already,” A-zam-ee bared their teeth at me. Which wasn’t a great</span> <span class="calibre2">look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Azamee held the guardrail looking at the giant green tray of a field. Something began to fall from</span> <span class="calibre2">the ceiling of the stadium. Being let down on a rope to almost the fifty-yard line. It was a brief</span> <span class="calibre2">case.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“ARE YOU READY!” The crowd around us cheered. I noticed Azami bending their elbows. I</span> <span class="calibre2">recognized the look. Determination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The first person to get the briefcase back to their seat wins! Good luck Future Treat</span> <span class="calibre2">Employees!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">A horn blew, we heard hooting and hollering. I turned to run down to a gate allowing you field</span> <span class="calibre2">access. But I looked back to see if Azami followed me. They hadn’t. They had jumped the rail</span> <span class="calibre2">and were running across the field into a tunnel. I lost sight of them after they ran in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I turned to call Mia, but she also wasn’t in her seat. I looked back to the field and saw her</span> <span class="calibre2">running toward the case. She ran through the cheer-leading squads. Both teams looked at the</span> <span class="calibre2">competition confused.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I tried to jump over the railing, but my foot slipped. I regained my footing, but saw my other</span> <span class="calibre2">self-run back out of the tunnel holding a ladder.</span></p>
<p id="page_35" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“What is this?” I yelled. I jumped down to the field. My feet moved towards Mia, who now</span> <span class="calibre2">stood at the fifty-yard line looking for some way to get up. She turned towards me. I grabbed her</span> <span class="calibre2">waist and tried to lift her up. But Azami came behind us and swung the ladder at her. I dropped</span> <span class="calibre2">her just in time. The ladder had missed her by inches.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">The crowd cheered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“The hell you doing Azamee!” I screamed, charging at myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Winning.” They screamed back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Azami set up the ladder and climbed as I checked on Mia to make sure she was okay. They</span> <span class="calibre2">grabbed each silver step as fast as they could. I shoved the ladder. The whole structure came</span> <span class="calibre2">crashing. The case waved back and forth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I looked in all directions trying to find something to help my friend out with. I had to have</span> <span class="calibre2">something. I couldn’t keep standing there useless. With my mind blank, I tackled my future self</span> <span class="calibre2">at the knees. They threw a fist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She had found a way to stand the ladder up. She leaped up and grabbed the suitcase, but the</span> <span class="calibre2">ladder shook. Azami had thrown me against the metal. I planted my feet, trying to not knock the</span> <span class="calibre2">ladder over. I glanced up and saw her climbing down, with the case in hand. They came at me,</span> <span class="calibre2">pushing me back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia jumped before the ladder fell, landing on her feet on the grass below. Like she had practiced</span> <span class="calibre2">landing all those times back in cheer practice. She dashed towards the seats where we had been</span> <span class="calibre2">sitting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She tried to lead Azami through the cheerleaders still standing on the sidelines. Azami</span> <span class="calibre2">approached her as if they were a hunter stalking prey running through a forest of cheerleaders. I</span> <span class="calibre2">went for a tackle, but my future self pushed me down to the ground. Azami reached for Mia,</span> <span class="calibre2">who climbed partly up the railing. She stretched out with one hand. She swung the briefcase up</span> <span class="calibre2">in an effort to push herself past the railing and onto the seats above. But the force of the swing</span> <span class="calibre2">caused it to slip out of her fingers. And it fell below, right into Azami’s hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">She climbed over, and her sneakers landed on the floor below by seats. Azami climbed up. Mia</span> <span class="calibre2">began to strike at my older selves hand still holding onto the railing, intending to knock them</span> <span class="calibre2">down. But she stopped. She had that same pained look on her face. She couldn’t do it. Instead,</span> <span class="calibre2">she crossed her arms and stepped back. Giving them a hard look.</span></p>
<p id="page_36" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">My hands reached out to pull Azami down. But I was too late. Before I could get back up to the</span> <span class="calibre2">row above, they sat down with all the brief case.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“We have a winner!” They announced over the speakers. Mia, with her hands folded, sat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Panting, from having skipped out on P.E. class too many times, I returned to my seat. My other</span> <span class="calibre2">self held the case tight. It reminded me of those nature films where some animals hold the dead</span> <span class="calibre2">thing in their mouths. All proud or whatever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Dude, you almost hit her,” I accused. “What were you thinking? Why would you…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“You could have killed me, Azami,” Mia sat wide eyed. “You were going to hit me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“In a few minutes it’s not going to matter.” They barked. “I don’t have to answer you.” They sat</span> <span class="calibre2">up, adjusting the briefcase across their chest. “I keep starting a new shift every time I get back to</span> <span class="calibre2">the store. I’ve been doing this for a while. I know how to win.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Mia’s hand shook with disappointment. “You seen other me’s? And Aurore’s?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Not you Mia….Don’t worry about it.” They leaned forward in their padded stadium seat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I leaned closer. “What happens to the losers of this game? Shift? Whatever this thing is. The ones</span> <span class="calibre2">who don’t get to the “reset point”. What happens?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">Azami didn't answer. “Everyone, who doesn’t make it to the reset point is okay. Then the</span> <span class="calibre2">company gives everyone cupcakes and giant hugs. They care. Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Every shift? You do this. Over and over?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Told you when I first met you, I was planning on being the one to get out, and nothing you did</span> <span class="calibre2">mattered. I told one of you anyways. I guess I didn’t think time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Let’s get out of here,” I threw my head back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Yes,” She stood up. “I’ll meet you outside.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“See you, gatekeeper,” They waved.</span></p>
<p id="page_37" class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I stood up and shook my head. “Are you going to sit here? We don’t have a lot of time left on</span> <span class="calibre2">this shift.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“I’ve done this before. If I don’t see you again, like peacefully? Good luck.” They slurred their</span> <span class="calibre2">syllables.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Screw you too.” I walked away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre2">***</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I almost left the stadium, but a video ad in the food area caught my eye. “Have drinks delivered</span> <span class="calibre2">to your seat!” I looked towards the field. Helmets clanked and the whistle blew. Fans cheered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Hey,” I yelled to a woman vending a cart. “What’s the strongest drink you got?” I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">They looked at me. “You got I.D?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">I ordered Azami, something strong, called a ‘Mind Eraser’.</span></p>
<p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre2">“Seat 111. Tell them I said Happy birthday. Put as much booze in it as you can.” I handed the</span> <span class="calibre2">woman a 20-dollar bill and walked away.</span></p>
