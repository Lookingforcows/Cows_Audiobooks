        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="IMG_9307.PNG" alt="Looking for Cows" class="profile-pic" width="150">
        <p>Looking for cows is the Gamertag of M.P Temple, who has been writing since high school. After two college theatre productions and countless screenplays, Cows wanted a way to share the creativity found in their unique stories. They also grew tired of the paywalls, and audio content so drowned in capitalism that commercials seem to fill up the air time. There is a better world out there where stories are art, engaging, and free. This led to "The Aurore Reset", a novella-sized audiobook about learning to love oneself that anyone can enjoy without a subscription or listening limits.</p>
        <p>Here cows discovered a love for narrating, a love that perhaps borderlines on addiction. So now Cows reads on, writing classic and original stories that showcase their weird and wacky personality with the flare of the dramatic. This is their collection of narrated audiobooks all in one podcast for you to enjoy for free.</p>
        <p>When Cows isn't working on new episodes, they can be found playing Dead by Daylight or playing piano. Their heart also yearns to be by the ocean. Sometimes they dabble in unskilled art, some of which you can find on this site. If you have any questions or suggestions or want to play Dead by Daylight, you can contact them via their socials. Links are in each episode. Thank you for stopping by, and good luck looking for cows out there.</p>
