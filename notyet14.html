<p> </p> GGGGAAAAAAHHHHHHHH I just. I can't even with you right now. I feel totally frustrated that I keep asking you not to do something, but yet you keep doing it.
Is it really that funny to you? I've had to learn how to code HTML just in case some pErSoN ever actually clicked on the photo more than once. And I've had to sit here all the
hours it's taken to make this and think "What kind of jerk would make me do this? I trusted you." I don't mean that. I'm really mad and hurt. I do think you are great. But you are 
doing not great things to me right now. you are totally going to click again, aren't you? Go ahead. I've learn to numb the pain years ago. This is nothing.  Go ahead. </p>
