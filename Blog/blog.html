    <h2> January 11th 2025</h2>
    <p> Hello, cow watchers. </p>
    <p> I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed listening to ‚ÄúWhisper‚Äôs Bay.‚Äù Like each audiobook that comes out on Cow‚Äôs Audiobooks, this one took a lot of hard work. 
        For as random and chaotic as it feels the story has a very strong structure. I wanted to talk a little about some of what into making this 4-hour light-hearted
        adventure. When I started it I wrote it desperately missing living on the coast. When I released it? Well, let‚Äôs just say some of the local beach town folks 
        might not like me suggesting that people are secretively and have their societies out here. I‚Äôm not sure how I ended up back on the beach. But like Luni,
        I found myself here. With new pains and challenges. There‚Äôll be some talk of ‚ÄúWhisper‚Äôs Bay‚Äù spoilers. So if you haven‚Äôt already, go listen.</p>
    <p> The roots of this audiobook started the first time I listened to Jim Dale read the entirety of Harry Potter. Growing up I had heard so much about, 
        it and had even angry friends who didn‚Äôt get their Hogwarts letter. Not going to lie, back then I was bitter and thought it was cool to hate things people
        liked to be cooler. I have issues, but if you‚Äôve followed along with the podcast that was obvious a long time ago. </p>
    <p> So as an adult, I decided I was going to give the entire series a fair chance. There is a lot to love about, and my favorite part of listening through was hearing 
        the parts that brought so many of my friends joy. But can we have a real talk? There are some serious cultural issues going on here. Yes, the main characters need obstacles.
        But the world is so nasty that by the end I found myself glad I wasn‚Äôt a part of that world. In the end, I desperately wanted to hang out with Hermione and Luna Lovegood. 
        Instead, the best the author could do was to write a husband and put herself in the book to later be his wife. That and we got to listen to Ron being a racist. So confirmed.
        The rough draft, titled ‚ÄúLuni and the Yokai Child.‚Äù was a Harry Potter reaction. Yes. The title is a jab. I went in a different way pietyness piety-wise unexpectedly in that
        one. Which was overall, why would anyone want to be a part of that world? Even with all the fun magical universe?</p>
<p> </p>I‚Äôd like to add that Luni is a variation of Luna, but that‚Äôs not why I named the character that. The name choice is always complicated when I‚Äôm writing these stories,
    and it was funny to me that the only sane character in the story is named Luni. It worked out that way. I poke fun at the novels, but I spend a lot of time trying to be original
    and creative new things. That is part of why there is not a new series every month. These main characters are very much like a relationship I had with someone once. We two people 
    were desperately in love but didn‚Äôt know how to love each other. It drove both of us to crazy and back. That might be a trend in the podcast, but I try hard to make sure while it
    might start from similar stock that the spices are different. It‚Äôs a cute magnetic dysfunctional adorable relationship. 
 <p> The original free-write draft ends in episode 5. At that point, I didn‚Äôt feel like completing the draft was beneficial. This is when I started learning that bigger is better in terms of storytelling. Bigger doesn‚Äôt always mean the universe is ending, but the bigger the problem the more interesting it is. The original draft moved way too slowly. It was also about two magic users who hid their powers from each other. I got bored writing that sentence. Sometimes ideas sound awesome, but a week later it‚Äôs the lamest thing ever. There‚Äôs also this struggle for me to keep things chill, yet engaging. This is always going to be a challenge I‚Äôm actively working on. When I finished ‚ÄúSaku of the Skull Talkers‚Äù and had nothing to write, I returned to the seed of the idea of the draft. </p>   
<p> Maybe it‚Äôs strange that the backbone for this story happens to be close to ‚ÄúLost in Translation.‚Äù When I talk about the story backbone I‚Äôm not talking about any of the main themes, or characters. I am referring to the structure in which the story is set out. Two people meet. Their lives change forever. But they can't be forever. Understand this isn‚Äôt a thing I set out to do. I wrote it, then realized when I was re-writing it that it is the backbone. This helped me fine-tune the story. Sort of like when I used to write music and found something I did sounded like something else. Instead of throwing it out, like I used to do, I listen to it and see how the artist handled the music from a technical standpoint. Then I can see how my creation stacks up. One of my favorite parts about this happy accident is how ridiculous it all is. Yet how special what Luni and Taylor have. Even though bittersweet.</p>
<p> These are the type of stories I enjoy, the Princess Dairies slash Shop around the Corner type of things. Those smaller more personal sort of kind of stories. <p>
    
</p> The more I write these, the less I plot out. There‚Äôs a lot of online writing talk about being a plotter or a pants-er or whatever. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm either really. In the last two series, I have basically in my mind created writing goalposts so to speak, like an idea or an event in the story that happens next. Then as I write I complicate everything as much as I can as my characters try to achieve their goals. I have to know where I am writing, and I have to know my main characters. I feel there are some improvements to be made on this, but this seems to be the way I work now. Things feel fresher in these last two series than in ‚ÄúThe Aurore Reset‚Äù. I‚Äôm always looking to improve, so please if you have suggestions let me know. </p>
 <p> The most amazing part of this series is I almost trashed it again. In this sudo-second draft, but not really, I got to about the same point in the story and wasn‚Äôt feeling it. I hadn‚Äôt established why the two couldn‚Äôt co-exist and without something character-driven happening nothing works. Not until I played Hogwarts Legacy did everything start working. Strangely.          </p>     
 <p> There‚Äôs a moment in the game when there‚Äôs a memory potion. I had not read that part of the Harry Potter books yet. So I‚Äôm sitting there with the controller thinking ‚ÄúOkay, so I drink the potion.‚Äù<p>

<p>Then I saw the character poke their head under the liquid and I realized if that had been real life that might have some consequences. It felt like something Luni would do, someone who is not a magic user and sees something that is in a drinkable potion bottle. That‚Äôs not safe by the way, but I wrote that into the story. It drove things in a different direction and complicated the story in an interesting way (number 1 writing goal). Suddenly having someone else's memories would be something else, and I hope I get to explore that in other Whisper‚Äôs Bay stories. Someday. But when I wrote that I realized I couldn‚Äôt start having flashbacks at the end of the story. So I spend a day writing flashbacks. Oh. By the way. I hate flashbacks.<p>

<p>They are boring. Most of the time. Even in popular movies flashbacks seem to be showing the audience things they already know. It didn‚Äôt matter, I couldn‚Äôt start a random thing like that and expect the listeners to be okay with it. So I added it. Making each scene challenge how a character is seen. For example, at first, it might seem like Taylor is a bully. Yes. But not intentionally. But the next flashback she has made lunch for Luni. I found that helped show who these characters are. Honestly, I feel like those are some of the best moments. <p>

<p>One part that I really hope will be a welcomed addition to the podcast is background music. I‚Äôve had music in there before, but looking through my numbers I realized a lot of my listeners were younger. Most of that age range like sound effects and full cast audio recordings. I feel a background score is a fair compromise. I find sound effects annoying, and I often record lo-fi music in the background so it fits. Fun fact I‚Äôve been playing piano and writing music for, oh no 20 some odd years. You can hear some of my old tunes in the score. I might push this music aspect in the next series. <p>

<p>As of right now, I have no drafts or solid ideas for what is next. I like the vibe of a space opera. But not if it‚Äôs like Star Wars. In my Google Docs there are a few seeds of ideas I am playing with, so who knows? There‚Äôs something else I‚Äôm looking for, an editor. Someone who understands the audio format. No offense to you English majors doing it as a part-time job, but I‚Äôve struggled to find a second pair of eyes. If you know someone who wants a freelance job or wants to help please contact me. <p>

        <h2>December 7, 2024 Update</h2>
        <p>Hello, fellow cow watchers,</p>
        <p>
            Lookingforcows.com is a thing! That is a random thing to update the site about suddenly, but big things are
            coming. In a strange twist of fate, I worked in a coastal town. Life is strange, in a less toxic sort of way
            than some gaming companies out there hoping to not have to file bankruptcy soon. I‚Äôve been busy, but I have
            good news. Whisper‚Äôs Bay is coming soon. Very soon. I have a new studio set up, a story, and some amazing
            artwork coming from the podcast's adopted freelance artist. (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/castleblockart/">Castleblockart</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
            I love the new story so much, that I can not wait to share it. This might sound vain, but I also wrote my
            favorite villain of all time. Do take that with a grain of salt because that is a ‚Äúyou have to read between
            the lines‚Äù statement sort of thing. When you hear the story, you‚Äôll know what I mean. My point is, beware

            With one series almost ready, it brings the dread of coming up with new ideas. I am in no rush. Bless those
            who are in the grind turning whatever out to make content, but I have no interest. I like to think of Cow‚Äôs
            Audiobooks as a specialty shop so to speak. Maybe like a ‚Äúnot a magic tea shop‚Äù sort of place. When there is
            a new tea product on the menu, it‚Äôs been grown, nurtured, and ensured there is no ill-intent on hwhitlocks.

            I also started a mailing list! So let‚Äôs have a real moment here. I hate mailing lists. Spam sucks. You don‚Äôt
            need to get an email from me every day. I‚Äôm not sure what my goals are there, but I like the idea of a few
            messages a year. I might talk about some cows I‚Äôve seen. It‚Äôs going to be chill.

            Like I told someone recently, we are making art here at lookingforcows.com. There is no rush. Do you know
            why? Because you should also be out there. Looking for cows. That‚Äôs what this is all about. So. I‚Äôll get
            back to work on bringing you some verbal ear company as you look. Check back here on the site soon. Let‚Äôs
            make art here.

 <h2>May 30, 2024 Update</h2>    
    <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my new site. I thought this might be a nice place to get away from the wasteland the internet has become. Aren't things grand? Yay! Anyhow, I'm glad you are here. I'll try to post to this as often as I can. I am currently taking a day-long break from recording "The Shepherd of the Hills", but hope to be back at it by tomorrow. The dialogue and the dialect have been a challenge, and it seems to leave me mentally exhausted a lot easier than "Pride and Prejudice" did. But I will keep at it! Good luck looking for cows out there.</p>

            I am at work writing original stories as well. I have about three hours of story that I feel good about, but sometimes after putting things away and coming back to them, they don't feel so good. One of the things I am working on I started back in 2001. It was called the Clone Chronicles back then, but I don't think I'll be using that title. 17 and 18-year-old me tried hard, but there is a lot of story garbage to clean so to speak.

            Okay, you talked me into it. Here's a rough draft, let me know what you think. Laters!
